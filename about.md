# Who Am I?

My nickname is Wookie.  It is a college nickname, the details are long and boring.  It is what most people call me, outside of family.

Other than that, I'm just a guy with a blog.

# What Is Going On Here?

This is just a place to type words that shows up (sometimes) where everyone in the world can see them. Anything could show up here: personal observations, opinions, incoherent swearing, links to stuff I find interesting, or whatever.

# "Incoherent Swearing"?

I'm a potty-mouth.  I have opinions.  Sometimes, those two things collide in my brain and the results show up here.

# Wook Elsewhere

I spent a while looking at some other, lesser-known, social networks.  I also have accounts on some more-known social networks. Here is the list of the ones I remember joining:
