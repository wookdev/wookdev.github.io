Munge: /muhnj/, vt.
===================

1. [derogatory] To imperfectly transform information.
1. A comprehensive rewrite of a routine, data structure or the whole program.
1. To modify data in some way the speaker doesn't need to go into right now or
cannot describe succinctly (compare *[mumble][]*).
1. To add *[spamblock][]* to an email address.

This term is often confused with
*[mung][]*, which probably
was derived from it. However, it also appears the word munge was in common
use in Scotland in the 1940s, and in Yorkshire in the 1950s, as a verb, meaning to munch
up into a masticated mess, and as a noun, meaning the result of munging something up (the
parallel with the *[kluge][]*/*[kludge][]* pair is amusing). The OED reports “munge” as
an archaic verb meaning “to wipe (a person's nose)”.
