The Marriott Milwaukee West, the hotel I've basically been living in for the last 6 months, sent a package to my appartment.  I found it here when I got home today.

We are not talking a cheesy something-or-other gift bulk mailed from Marriott central.  We are talking an actual gift, hand-addressed to me here, and mailed from Waukesha, WI.  It is probably still a choice from some executive gift service, but all indications are that someone at the Marriott in question touched this thing on its way to me.

It is even a gift I can use, though I do already have a cork-puller and foil-cutter.  They sent me a nice corkscrew set.  Made of real metal, with rubber grips, and a foil-cutter.  It is nice.

<blockquote>
I just bought a book, something like " The Downtown Girl's Guide to Wine". This was purchased after a trip to Sonoma County for some uneducated wine-tasteing, and feeling very  out of it. The first chapter talks about the simple supplies needed for your at-home bar. One was a foil cutter. I'd never heard of such a thing, cuz I'm just starting to be a Downtown Girl, I guess. And then to find out that my son has two of them. Wow.
