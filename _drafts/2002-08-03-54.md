Buffalo, NY. Niagara Falls. I saw Buffalo, and by being there was a 20 minute
drive from Niagara Falls. I did not see Niagara Falls. I could have, being only
20 minutes away. But I didn't.

Next time I go there I'm going to try to remember to bring the camera bag,
and hopefully I'll get to take pictures of the Falls.

Home today, after having to stay over night in Buffalo because the weather
here prevented getting home last night. The Radisson Hotel in Buffalo by the
airport is kind of a dump.

The power keeps going out here. Or at least flickering enough to turn everything
off. This is one of those &quot;Summer time SNAFUs&quot; of living here. This
is playing hell with my TiVo. Twice now I've left only to come back and the
cable box is off. And it usually gets turned off the day after I leave, rather
than the day before I come back. I'm missing shows I would otherwise watch.
Still, I get to see some stuff, and without the TiVo, there would be no chance
of seeing anything.
