My blogging activities started shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11th,
2001 happened.  On November 12th American Airlines flight 587
[crashed on takeoff from JFK][aa587].  I was in London for work that week, and
my voicemail pretty quickly loaded up with family asking where I was and if I was
okay.  I was, but I didn't have a mobile phone that worked in the UK, so I had no
way to listen to them, or respond.

I decided I needed a way to let my family know where I was, so they could have
some idea of the chances of me being in some major catastrophe.  The US was kind
of in the mindset at the time that catastrophes were something that were going
to be a fact of life from then on.  Planning on and around them didn't seem like
an odd thing to be doing.

The sensible thing, looking back, would have been to use a shared calendar
somewhere on the web, and give my family access.  I have no idea why
that didn't seem like a good idea 13 years ago.

Instead, I started posting on a website my comings, goings, and whereabouts, in
a "web journal" format. The site was static; I wrote the first html pages by hand
using the vi text editor.

After editing by hand for a while, I moved to using DreamWeaver.  The site was
still static, but Dreamweaver allowed me to edit in WYSIWYG, and send the
resulting files to the web server with the push of a button.
Even that's a pain tho, so I moved from there to using [Moveable Type][].
Munged.Org was based on MT until about 2009 or so.

I joined Facebook in 2008, and started actually participating in 2009, and that
killed any blogging I might have continued doing.

I hadn't been writing in the blog much anyway, because I was travelling so
much.  My time all went to dealing with trying to live a life in hotels
and airports.  But while the shiny lasted, FB was a lot of fun, and my friends
turned out to be interesting, creative, hilarious, people.

The idea of writing a blog wouldn't die tho.  Sometime since 2009, I set up a
[WordPress][] blog on the same web server I'd had the
Moveable Type blog on.  I didn't post much.  Those posts I did make are gone,
because when I finally took that site down, it doesn't seem I managed to save
anything.

I also tried Tumblr for a while.  Again, not much went up there, and none of it
saved when I stopped using it.

I even upgraded DreamWeaver again at some point, and was going to do a static
web site again.  I never got to the point of having it show up on the web.

Last year, in April of 2014, to be precise, I created a web site with Squarespace.
Munged.Org is there as I type this.  Hasn't been much going on over there, tho.

And now you are caught up.  Almost.
