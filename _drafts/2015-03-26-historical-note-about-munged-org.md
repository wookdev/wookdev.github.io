My blogging activities started shortly after 9/11 happened, even tho I'd been dicking
around with the web for a couple of years by then.

What happened was that shortly
after the terrorist attacks of September 11th, [American Airlines flight 587
crashed on takeoff from JFK][aa587].  I was in London for work that day, and
my voicemail pretty quickly loaded up with family asking where I was and if I was
okay.  I was, but I didn't have a mobile phone that worked in the UK, so I had no
way to listen to them, or respond.

I decided I needed a way to let my family know where I was, so they could have
some idea of the chances of me being in some major catastrophe.  The US was kind
of in the mindset at the time that catastrophes were something that we just going
to be a fact of life from them on.

The sensible thing, looking back, would have been to use a shared calendar
somewhere on the web, and invite my family to be able to view is.  I have no idea why
that didn't seem like a good idea 13 years ago.  I vaguely remember rejecting
the idea of using Yahoo's calendar.  I have no idea what I didn't like about
it.

Instead, I started posting on a website my comings, goings, and whereabouts, in
a "web journal" format.  I wrote the first html pages by hand in vi.  After a while of
doing that, I bought DreamWeaver, since it was _The Shit_ at that point.

These posts on this site now, start at that website.  They haven't been on
Munged.Org since sometime in 2009, when I stopped using the Movable Type content
management system.

After the Movable Type period, there was a flitration with WordPress. But those
blog posts are all gone.  WP stored everything in a database and generated the
web pages dynamically as they were accessed.  When I stopped using WP, the database
was gone.  I didn't download it, or lost the file.  There weren't many posts in WP,
so there really isn't much missing.

After WordPress, I was going to try using DreamWeaver to do a site statically.
I still had DreamWeaver, and had even been upgrading it over the years. The MT
and WP sites had been hacked to serve pornography so often I was tired of them.
A static web site is harder to hack, and the hacking is more noticeable when it
happens.

The static thing, basically never even made it to a web page.

I tried Tumblr next. Useful, I guess. Never really did much with it.

Next in line was SquareSpace, where <www.munged.org> is still as I write this.
Square is nice, and it was really easy to create a good-looking site in almost
no time at all. My complaints with Square are minor.  Because the focus is on
pretty web sites, I can't find the minimalist, clean, look I'd prefer.  All the
templates are way too much whitespace, around way to large pictures.  All the
words show up halfway down the browser window, or lower.  The actual editing
tools were okay, but everything was busy and distracting.

I haven't been posting much there either.  Partly for those reasons, but also
because of Facebook.

All the witty stuff I'd been typing into the blog in days past went into FB instead.
While being hacked was half the reason I stopped blogging, the other half was that
FB was fulfilling my creative outlet.  I joined FB in 2008, and started really
participating in it in 2009.
