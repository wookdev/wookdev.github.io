Okay folks, I've found a great way to save energy: Use lightbulbs so powerfull that you keep them off for fear of getting skin cancer.

For whatever reason, my kitchen goes though light bulbs at an astonishing rate.  Seems like I'm up on a chair replacing bulbs every couple of months.  I blew out the last one just before I went to DC last week.  I was kind of pissed off, so I figured I'd try to fill all three sockets in the fixture, on the theory that I might make it through the end of this year before all three of them can blow out.

Turns out one of the sockets has a busted bulb in it, so I could only put two bulbs in.  And I only had 75 watt bulbs available.  But, it turns out that 150 watts of light is a little on the overly radiant side for the small, kinda white, kitchen.

These bulbs are the GE "Reveal" lights, that are slightly purple.  They seem less glaring, and produce a nicer light.  But 150 watts is still a lot, even if it is good light.  The first time I turned them on when I arrived home from DC, I thought my kitchen had blown up.

So now I keep them off, and only go into the kitchen when I really need something.
