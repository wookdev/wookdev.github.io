title: "Fuzzy Sock Season"
datestr: November 23, 2008

Yesterday it was "Winter Cold" outside, for the first time so far this year.  It's been chilly, but not parkas-zipped-all-the-way-up cold.  Not that it gets that cold here by Minnesota standards, but it was unequivocally a cold day in NYC yesterday.

It took me all night, and all of this morning, but it as I was rummaging around in my sock drawer just now, it occurred to me that the big fuzzy socks I've been avoiding all summer, are finally in season again.  Yes, I'm a little slow, but I do get there.
