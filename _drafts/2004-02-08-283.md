A friend of mine, who shall remain <acronym title="Rachelle">nameless</acronym> sent in these questions of the universe:
<blockquote>Hmm, is that thing frozen inside? The stuff is blue, right? So is it like anti freeze and it stays liquid? Or has it , right now even as I type,  become the dreaded "blue ice" of legend. But doesn't that just come from airplanes? And if not, how is the porta john company gonna service/empty the darn thing in sub freezing weather? Does it work like uh, a  jello mold? Does it have changable liners like a cat's litter box? Or do they replace it with a fresh one and haul the frozen one back to a garage someplace to thaw out. (eeeeeewww) Does the "honey dipper" truck have a heating element to handle this issue? And if so, does the "dipper man" get combat pay for these adverse situations?</blockquote>

I'm not sure what frame of mind you have to be in, or mental process you have to go thru, to get to wondering about this, but now that <acronym title="Rachelle">she's</acronym> asked, they must be answered.  Anyone know how this works?
