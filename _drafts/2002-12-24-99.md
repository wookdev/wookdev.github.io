I let myself &quot;go home early&quot; today, and did movies all day. I saw
&quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; this afternoon, and &quot;About Schmidt&quot; this
evening. I was going to re-watch LotR in a better theater, but it sold out just
as I got there, so I saw &quot;Two Weeks&quot; instead.

&quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; was a nice little comedy. Nothing special, and
totally predictable. Watch it when it hits cable.

&quot;About Schmidt&quot; was pretty good. About a guy suffering from depression
after retirement, and his search for self-worth. Truly astounding performances
by Nicholson and Kathy Bates. Nicholson managed a character, rather than &quot;Your
old buddy Jack&quot; where his own personality comes through strongly. Kathy
Bates stole the show, she was so good.

Susan and Rob saw &quot;About Schmidt&quot; with me.
