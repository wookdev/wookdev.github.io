In These Times, I felt is was important to keep in touch with as many of my loved ones as possible.  Normally, I would wait for our times together to come around naturally thru our collective wanderings.  But during These Times, I didn't want to wait, and take the chance of not being able to connect with someone again.

So, uh....  Facebook.

I left facebook a little over [two years ago](http://www.munged.org/2017/11/10/deleted-fb/ "Left Facebook").

Nothing has changed in my opinion of Facebook.  I've been back for a few hours so far, and I'm already done with it.  It's not that I don't like the people I've friended, I do like them all.  But not everyone can put together an engaging, entertaining online presence.  (Yes, I'm probably throwing stones.)

Is that fair?  Probably not.  Do I care?  No.  When I first joined FB way back in the dark ages, there were a collection of us that were always in each others walls, being hilarious. It was a good time.  It lasted about six months, and then... I'm not sure.  Maybe we all ran out of jokes, or our personal styles stopped being funny after too much repetition, or there was energy invested that we couldn't sustain.  It was all of us, I'm pretty sure, or maybe it was just me.  Whatever it was, participating on FB was never as good again.

If I'm honest, I'm not sure what I expect.  If someone catches The COVID, will they post or just stop posting completely?  Will it be possible to help them if they do?  How do I know what's going on when it occurs to me that someone hasn't posted in a while?  Are they sick?  Withdrawing?  Or just have nothing to say or add to the public conversation?

My feeling at this time, is this is something I'll do until the end of this year, or early next year.  Once thing are back to normal societally, or at least some resemblance, then I'll probably save myself the energy, and bail.

But this time, when I bail, I'm gonna make sure I have contact info stored off FB for people I didn't think to do that for the first time I left.
