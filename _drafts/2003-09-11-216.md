This arrived in today's email:
<blockquote>
Oh, another thing. I had to take my yearly anti-
terrorism training yesterday so I can travel to
other countries . In
case you wondered...
<li>vary your routine, don't be predictable</li>
<li>remain low-key</li>
<li>on airplanes, take a window seat near the middle
of the plane; hijackers usually secure passengers
from the front and back of the plane</li>
<li>in hotels, take a room on the 4th floor interior
to the hotel; its likely to be safer during street
bomb blasts and you can get out fast via fire
escapes</li>
<li>when calling from a public place to get directions,
never repeat details; ask the other party to repeat
details if you missed something</li>
<li>select clothing and transportation that blends in
with the local population</li>

There was more, but that's enough fun for tonight.

So now you know how to be safe.  This is probably good advise even in your neighborhood.
