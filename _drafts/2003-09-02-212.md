title: "TorCon 3 and Back Again"
datestr: September 02, 2003

I wasn't going to go to Torcon 3.  But then my schedule more or less cleared up for a long Labor Day weekend.  So I rented a car, found a hotel room, and went to the <a href="http://www.torcon3.com/" title="http://www.torcon3.com/">Toronto World Science Fiction Convention</a>.

I enjoyed the drive up to Toronto.  I-80 is butt-ugly, but it was the way to go from Newark Airport.  I had to stop in at Newark because I was in NJ for a couple of meetings before I could go, and the rental car developed a "Check Transmission" warning when it went above 40 MPH.  I must say that the Newark Hertz office fixed me up pronto, and even let me park in an other-than-rental-return spot so it was easy to move all my crap from one car to the new one.

But that wasn't such a bad thing, because that caused me to drive I-81 between Scranton and Syracuse, which is heartbreakingly beautiful.  Going to have to do a photo expedition up there some time.

Highlights

* I got to hear <a href="http://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/">Terry Pratchett</a> read, and talked to him briefly.

* I met <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/">Eric Raymond</a> in an elevator, and we talked about his supposed fame, and how he's trying not to let it get to him.  I later met him in a room party, where I was able to produce a whole bunch of people who'd never heard of him.  I hope that helped.

* I listened to a speech by <a href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com/">George R.R. Martin</a>, the ProGoH.  I've not read his stuff, though I own a couple of his books.  It was a good speech, well plotted and interesting, which I enjoyed a lot.

* <a href="/pics/trumps-full.jpg"><img alt="Trumps of Amber Torcon 3 Masquerade Entry Photo" src="/pics/trumps-full-thumb.jpg" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="right" /></a>The Pettingers organized a large masquerade entry with 18 people involved.  Quite impressive, they did the trumps of Amber.  They won best in show for the master division if I remember correctly.

* I got to be in the "Fan Photo Area" of the masquerade.  This was a large area in the green room for the masquerade, with risers, and a neutral background to photograph against.  I was specifically in the "available light" area, which was the part where they had set up 8 hot lights.  It was a warm spot to be, but I had fun taking photos.  Those photos will go up here soon.

* I went to a "Costume Photography" panel that was informative in a general way.  They didn't get very deep into the details I was looking for, but there was some good advice anyway.

* <a href="/pics/winter.jpg"><img alt="Winter Is Coming Torcon 3 Masquerade Entry Photo" src="/pics/winter-thumb.jpg" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="right" /></a>The Abba's and Rachelle, and a few others put together a masquerade entry based on a George R. R. Martin story.  It was also good, and very technical, as any Abba costume is.

* Surprising the gang with my (mostly) unannounced presence.  I am starting to get predictable in my surprising though.  I talked to them about the maybe I should start NOT showing at things I said I would show at.  They didn't seem to go for this one.

* After the masquerade, everyone was hungry, but it was almost 2 AM (if I remember correctly), and we didn't think anything would be open.  So we all went back to my hotel room, for 24-hour room service.  I called down for an order for the 10 of us, at 2:30 AM.  I showed the raw photos I'd taken.  We talked and joked, and had a good time.  They threatened my life.

All-in-all, it was a good con.

The drive back home was rough.  Nothing bad happened, but I waited at the border, in a HUGE line of cars, for 4 hours to cross over to the US.  Then drove all the way home in the rain, which was nice for about the first hour.  I got home about 1 AM or so, after spending an hour trying to find a place to park the car because I didn't get back while Hertz was open.  (I called them from the road, the extra day still falls under the weekly rate, which is nice.)

Despite that and the other normal collection of minor snags any trip entails, it was an okay weekend.

Will I do WorldCon again?  Not sure really.  I found myself thinking that I got more of the things I normally don't go to cons for (panels and guests), and less of the things I do go for (my friends).  So maybe that is okay if not good, but I'm not sure.  I left with a lingering feeling of dissatisfaction with the whole thing.  Course, I should probably give it another chance, since I wasn't in the same hotel as anyone I wanted to spend time with, and our cell phones mostly didn't work, which made it hard to have the contact with friends thing going.
