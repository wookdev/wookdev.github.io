At on point in Vegas this weekend, Haley came back from a ladies room with a smirk on her face.  Seems she had gone in there, and went into a stall that she'd had to wait for be vacated, to find the toilet seat up.

Just one of those Things That Make You Go "Hmmmmmm".

Undoubtedly a stand up pee-er. At least the seat had not been dribbled on as is often the case with those women who exercise this approach to relieving one's self. Fine, go ahead and hover, but if you are a dribbler, clean the hell up after your self-  and that includes at the base of the porcelain and the floor! There are apparently several "vile dribblers" in my office and I *wish* they would put the damn seat up before they did so! And then put it back the way they found it.  I don't want the splashy seat surprise.  It would make it a lot easier on us"Ladies" who have the good sense to do things they way our mothers taught us. Now pardon me while I go drink tea with my pinkee crooked and my legs daintily crossed while wearing pearls and making polite small talk.
