A <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7283155.stm">story from the BBC</a> about the Hitchhiker's radio show turning 30. The story mostly goes into the puzzle of the "Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything", which is "42".  I will never forget Deep Thought telling the gathered masses "You aren't going to like it."

My favorite part of the whole thing was in the books.  It was God's last message to His creation: "Sorry for the inconvenience."
