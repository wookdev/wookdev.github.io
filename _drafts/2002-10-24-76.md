Firstly, I would like to say that all joking aside, Susan is the coolest of
people. She did ask to be in the journal though. And Gerry did notice my silly
little oversight, but was giving me the benefit of the doubt. (She should know
better than that, but she is too nice some times.) Sarcasm sometimes doesn't
come through in written medium very well. Especially when I'm doing the writing.

Another trip into NJ today. Fort Lee, just over the George Washington bridge.
I allowed 2 hours to get there, and it took about 30 minutes total. Now I know,
I guess.

I'm still trying to come up with something to do for a vacation later next
month. Though actually, I'm still trying to figure out if I'll get a vacation
later next month. Might not work that way. I suppose I could try to trade away
the November vacation for an extra long New Years Eve vacation.

Now, that, is an idea worth exploring.

The thought of leasing a car has crossed into the conscious part of my mind
again. But I beat it back with a stick.
