title: "I Fondled Dave's Love Sac"

While I was at Dave and Haley's last week for Thanksgiving, Dave invited me to touch his <a href="http://www.lovesac.com/home.php" title="LoveSac">Love Sac</a>.  So I did.  I must say, Dave's <a href="http://www.lovesac.com/home.php" title="LoveSac">Love Sac</a> is really big.  He even let me fluff his <a href="http://www.lovesac.com/home.php" title="LoveSac">Love Sac</a>.  I fell asleep on his <a href="http://www.lovesac.com/home.php" title="LoveSac">Love Sac</a> once too.

I got to flop on a Love Sac this week.  I can see why you enjoyed Dave's so much. It's nice he's willing to share. : )
