I feel like Steve Martin jumping up and down screaming "The new phonebooks are here!  The new phonebooks are here!"  My excitement is over something a little less strange than knowing you are somebody because your name is finally in the phonebook, though no less exciting for me.

 My <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/usa_product/product.jsp?cat=1&grp=2&productNr=25206">new camera</a> arrived today.  All the associated parts (2nd battery, <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/usa_product/product.jsp?cat=1&grp=5&productNr=1923NCP">shorter lens</a>, battery pack, etc) all arrived last week, and have been sitting forlornly on my coffee table waiting to be useful.  Well, today is that day.  As soon as the batteries are charged ("Damnit!  You mean I have to WAIT?!?") I'll be set.
