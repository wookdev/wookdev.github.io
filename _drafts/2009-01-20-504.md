Something strange has happened to me, and I'm not quite sure what to make of it.

The housekeeper came today, and made the Wookie Improvement Plan Location (my apartment) spic 'n' span, and lemony fresh.  Today at work was kind of long, and I have a 2 day meeting Thurs-Fri that I'm dreading.  So when I got home, I just wanted to chill, make a sandwich, drink a beer maybe, watch some inauguration coverage on the tube, and **not** go downstairs and get some exercise.

So imagine my surprise to discover I was hunting thru the clean clothes the housekeeper washed for me to find shorts to work out in.  Then imagine my surprise to find myself in the elevator to the basement.  And even more surprised to find myself on a treadmill, going nowhere at 3.5 MPH up a 3% grade while watching "The Biggest Looser" on the TV with no sound.

I didn't want to go down there.  It wasn't in the plan.  The Biggest Looser was not what I wanted to be watching.  But for some reason, I did it anyway.

And that kind of thing is just so unlike me, I'm not sure I approve.

Well, I approve! Now you need to teach me how to do that...
