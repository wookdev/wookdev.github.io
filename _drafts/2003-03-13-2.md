This site has changed, or rather, is changing, to a content management system called <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Moveable Type (MT)</a>. The site will look mostly similar to what it has been so far, once I get all the formatting done.  The key is "once I get all the formating done".  This thing is still a work in progress, and will change as things go, though the goal is for the final product to look like it always has.

The links to the left all still work, and point at the old areas still.  I'm working on importing all the journal entries into MT.  I still haven't figure out how to make the Humor and Rants sections fit.  There isn't a photo gallery plug-in for MT yet, so that will probably remain an exercise in <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphoto/">iPhoto</a>/<a href="http://www.droolingcat.com/software/betterhtmlexport/">BetterHTMLExport</a>, along with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/">Photoshop</a> and <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/fireworks/">Fireworks</a>. (Don't ask.)

Why am I making this change?

Up until now, I've been using <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/">MacroMedia's Dreamweaver</a> to build and manage the sites.  Dreamweaver is a wonderfull bit of software, and made the monstrosity of managing my sites possible. (Munged.Org has over 2700 files in it, of various types.)  However, DW's dynamic content stuff is basically ColdFusion, which isn't simple, and I don't have the environment here to support it correctly.

DW doesn't travel well, either.  I own the Mac version, since I have a Mac here at home.  DW is not one of those apps where you get all versions when you buy it. Which sucks.  So I can't put it on my work laptop (Win2k) to work on the site from the road.

And the best way to update this stuff is via the web site itself anyway.  Now I'm hoping that I can just "pop in" and put in short little updates.  Hopefully, the amount of posting I do should go up.  Hopefully.  <grin>

So, please be patient while I get all the sub-areas into MT, and get everything converted.
