I am far too talentless to have committed this bit of artistry.  It is something I bought a while ago.

It finally arrived here at Wook Central today, and I unpacked the <a href="http://www.munged.org/photo/journal/apt1/Pages/5.html" title="The Crate">crate</a> and hung the <a href="http://www.munged.org/photo/journal/apt1/Pages/6.html" title="Wook's New Painting">picture</a> on the wall above my couch.  It pretty much takes up the ENTIRE wall, above the couch.

The painting is by Michael John Hill</a>, an artist in the UK.  It is of a foggy scene, and is painted is such a way that as you lower the light level, the painting goes through the phases of sunset, or sunrise.  It is uncanny.  It is also hard to describe, so I'm not going to try.

I got my painting at <a href="http://www.atlasgalleries.com/" title="Atlas Galleries">Atlas Galleries in Chicago</a>.
