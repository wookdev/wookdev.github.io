Well, its actually my only favorite cooking site.
But what the hell.

I think I might actually try <a href="http://eatdangerously.com/spaghetti.html">"Spaghetti That Will Make You Cry"</a> this weekend.

Thanks to my friend Mike who pointed me to this site in a comment to the <a href="/2003/10/14/2003-11-14-233" title="Turkey Nuts Entry">Turkey Nuts</a> entry.
