The Move starts in about 10 minutes.  I do not yet have phone or cable upstairs, so I won't be on the internet until everything gets hooked up in the new place.  I've been so busy with work that I'm not even sort of ready for this, but it will happen anyway.

I'll pick up my personal mail from work.  Call me on my cell phone.

You are all invited to the party when I get set up.
