Today was the last day at RiverSoft. I started out waiting for my new Isomair
laptop to arrive. FedEx got it here at almost 3PM. So I rushed into the RiverSoft
office to finish my last expense report, turn in my stuff, and get my last couple
of checks.

The office was in a state of disarray, to put it mildly. Muse people were in
the office to shut it down. They were organizing, tossing, and packing everything
up.

Anyway, I got my expense report done. Picked up my last paycheck, and vacation
pay, and left.

It felt good. If I'd died today, I'd have still had a smile that they would
have had to jackhammer off my face.

Then there was the &quot;Final Party&quot;, a reunion thing. Only Christine,
Sean, Howard, and Pam showed. But Sean, Howard, and Christine brought the significant
others along, so there were 8 of us, which was enough to make it interesting.

I got a little tipsy, and got home by 3:00 or so.
