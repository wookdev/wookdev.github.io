My friend <a href="http://www.gack.com">Susan</a> sends out humor every week.  She is connected to some serious web-surfers, and also some seriously creative and tallented people.  Like <a href="http://www.techno-impressionist.com/">Tony</a> here, for one.  This collection of friends of hers sends her interesting stuff when they find it, and she forwards it.

Susan has that rarest of all mutant abilities: the ability to send out humor on the net that nobody has ever seen before.  The only time I've ever seen the stuff she sends out is when I'm the person that sent it to her.
