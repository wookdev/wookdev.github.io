title: "Up Too Early"
datestr: October 10, 2004

One of those emails I have never deleted yet because it gives me a little chuckle when I read it.  Still, better not to have it in my email, where it can get lost.

Also illustrates the dangers of me being up way to early.  I normally tend not to be willing to communicate before I start work, and this would be an perfect example of why not.

Why would you possibly want to get rid of the nice balloons? &lt;grin&gt;

Must be a tie in to the fear that there are clowns hiding in my closets...

Obviously being up too early has made you too mean!
