title: "I've Found Religion!"
datestr: September 04, 2005

I'm a <a href="http://www.venganza.org/" title="Open Letter">Pastafarian</a>.

Another decent source of information is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, which has collected a bunch of information about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monsterism" title="Flying Spaghetti Monsterism">Flying Spaghetti Monsterism</a>.

Why FSM is right for me (from the web site):
<ul>
<li>Flimsy moral standards.</li>
<li>Every friday is a relgious holiday. If your work/school objects to that, demand your religious beliefs are respected and threaten to call the ACLU.</li>
<li>Our heaven is WAY better. We've got a Stripper Factory AND a Beer Volcano.</li>
</ul>

Okay, so this isn't why I'm joining.  I'm joining because I have been touched by his noodly appendage, and now, the world and all the people in it, make sense.

Ok...so...if you're a Pastafarian and someone wants to crucify you...do they throw you against a wall to find out if you stick?

Gee I hope you're not allergic to basil, oregano, or cheese...communion would be hell.

I used to be a frisbetarian.  We believed that when you died, your soul got stuck on a roof.

Ok...so if the roof is purgatory (souls in limbo) what's hell & heaven?  Hell...in my opinion...would be dog's teeth & slobber as someone throws you around to be fetched by Fido!
