#Apps and Stuff

I try out iOS apps and Mac programs to see how they work.  More of the former,
since they are more often free.  But I do pay for apps I want to try too, since
they are often about as expensive as a cup of coffee now-a-days.

This is that list.

## Things I'm Trying Out Now

[Day One]

: >A journal app.  Originally downloaded as an "iOS app of the week" for free, but
  recently I bought the Mac version too.  I'd love to keep a journal, but so far
  haven't had the discipline.
