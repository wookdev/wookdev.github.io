As some know, I'm putting all of my CDs into iTunes on my Mac.  I'm just over half-way done now, with just over 20 Gig of <acronym title="MPEG 4 Audio">AAC</acronym> files on my hard drive.  All of my CDs should fit in just under 40 Gig of hard drive space.

So anyway, sooner or later, I have to get to ABBA.

I like ABBA.  Or rather, I liked the good stuff that ABBA did.  The gloriously soft, multi-tracked, female voices.  The toe-tappingly infectious pop tunes.  They were mindless pop at its best.

So I ripped and encoded the 4 ABBA CDs in the box set.  And then, because I don't want them all on the iPod, I played them, rated them, and turned off the ones I didn't like so much.  So far, so good.

But, I've just spent the last 4 hours listening to ABBA. <strong>ALL of ABBA.</strong> I managed to last what I thought was a long time, before signs of psychosis started to appear.  Around about half way through the second CD, I suddenly had this craving to go baby seal hunting.

I'm better now.  I went through the rest of ABBA as fast as I could, turning off anything I'd never heard before.  Now, I'm listening to Marilyn Manson, and life is in balance again.
