title: "Vegas 2006: Tuesday - Hedonism and Shows"
datestr: December 05, 2006

The first day in Las Vegas.  I tried the buffet, had a massage, shopped a little, saw some shows, and played some craps.  I lost at craps, but not so fast that I didn't have a good time doing it.

Tuesday, I got up, took a shower, and when down to try out the Wynn's buffet. In a fit of originality, they've named it &quot;The Buffet&quot;. I generally have a low opinion of buffets, in Vegas or anywhere. It is pre-prepared food for the most part, sitting there getting cold or under heat lamps waiting for you to take some. Made-to-order omelets are usually the only exception. And The Buffet and its food didn't change my mind at all. Don't get me wrong, it is the nicest, and best quality food I have ever had in a buffet in Vegas. But any other restaurant in the Wynn except room service would have delivered better food, and I think, for the same or even less money. At least for the amount of food I ate.

Then back up to my room for an in-room for a massage therapy session. Whenever possible, I try to do this in my room, rather than down in the spa, unless I'm planning on doing the hot tub or swim or something. This day, I wasn't intending to do any of that. The therapist was incredible, and mostly managed to straighten me out in the 90 minutes she worked on me. I proposed marriage to her, which I do to all massage therapists who are really good, and she duly declined. (This is a theme in my life, damn massage therapists.)

After working up the willpower to move, I headed off to pick up the tickets for K and Mystere. I went to the MGM Grand to get them both, with the intention of crossing the street to New York, New York and thru to the Luxor and maybe Mandalay Bay. Rather, I walked the strip back up to Monte Carlo, just seeing the sights, and from there took a cab back to the Wynn.

After serious deliberation, I decided to add Le R&ecirc;ve, the main show at the Wynn to my plan for the night.  K&agrave; started at 9:30, with a &quot;Must be seated by 9:15&quot; on the ticket. Le R&ecirc;ve started at 7:30, and would thus finish at 9:00, giving me 30 minutes to brave people leaving the Le R&ecirc;ve theater, the taxi stand, and traffic to the other end of the strip to get to the MGM Grand in time to sit down before K&agrave; opened. But, I was going to try it. At the very worse I'd miss out on K&agrave;, which I've seen before.

At the concierge's suggestion, I tried Okuda, the Japanese restaurant in the Wynn. The portions are all appetizer sized, so I was able to try a main course, and do some sushi as well. It was fabulously good. I tried a sampler of saki too, basically made up of the three different &quot;finishes&quot; of Saki. I reaffirmed that I'm not a fan of Saki, tho these were much better tasting than a lot I've tried.

Le R&ecirc;ve is not an actual Cirque Du Soleil show, though it was designed and written by the guy that did &quot;O&quot; and Mystere for Cirque Du Soleil. Thus, it was exactly a Cirque Du Soleil show in everything but name, and actually felt much more like &quot;O&quot; and Mystere than K&agrave; does. It is very, very cool, and I enjoyed it hugely. Done on a stage in a theater in the round setting. The stage is a pool, with a stage floor that raises and lowers into the pool. I want a room in a house decorated the same way the theater was dressed.

After Le R&ecirc;ve was over, I made my mad dash to the MGM to see K&agrave;. 

In the end, it worked perfectly, and in fact better than I expected. Le R&ecirc;ve ended at 9:00, and I was out of my seat on the way to the door as the cast was doing their curtain call. Rude of me, but I was on a time-table. I beat pretty much everyone out of the theater, even with a stop in the restroom. I beat everyone to the taxi stand. The cab driver knew that the strip was not mobbed, and took me in a much closer entrance of the MGM both from a taxi ride perspective, and a walking thru the casino to the theater perspective.

I got to the snack bar at 9:15, and was in my seat 10 minutes later.

Let me just mention my seat for K&agrave;. Usually, for Cirque Du Soleil, you want to be up a bit, so you can see everything. All the shows have action going on over and behind the audience. You want to be able to see all this, as well as take in the whole stage, since Cirque makes very good use of all of it. That was the kind of seat I had the first time I saw K&agrave;, so I told Tara the travel agent to put me down front a bit. And she did. My seat  was down front as it could be and not be on stage. Row A. Seat 4. At times, there was action going on 4 feet away from me. It was very cool, though I was glad I'd seen it from back farther once before.

K&agrave; ended, and by the time I got to the cab line, it was stupidly huge. So I again intended to walk over the New York, New York, and points beyond, in the search of some gambling or something. The night was yet young. What I ended up doing instead was going across the street to the Hooters Casino Hotel.

Yes, Hooters, the cheesy restaurant in almost every city in the country dedicated to dirty old farts like me, has a casino hotel in Vegas. It isn't a huge one, but it is there, and reasonably close to The Strip too, just behind the Tropicana. (Another one I've not been in but should check out some time.)

The casino of Hooters looks exactly like a Hooters restaurant anywhere in the country. EXACTLY like any hooters anywhere. We are talking tacky wood plank floors and paneling, crap stapled to the walls. There was a country western band playing in the casino, and rock band playing in a club toward the back. The girls were the same not-quite-pretty girls wearing t-shirts, short shorts, and pantyhose so thick you doubt their legs are real you see in all Hooters except the ones in Atlanta. (The only Hooters I've every been in where I thought the Hooters girls were actually good looking was in Atlanta. And the Hooters in Manhattan has the worse looking Hooters girls of any Hooters I've been to anywhere.)

The casino is small, smaller even than some of the casinos in downtown Vegas. Only one of their 3 craps tables was open, and it was a $5 minimum bet. I'd have played, just to say I did, but it was also overly full already. 

From there, I caught a cab back to the Wynn. I dropped my programs and coat in my room, and went down to play some craps. I went in with $900 (due to bad planning, I had to break a 100 dollar bill earlier), and played for about an hour or two. Being down $400 sounds big, but I was betting greens ($25 dollar chips) and you can loose $750 in one roll at that level, so this is actually not to bad.

Then, it was late, and still being on east coast time, I was winding down, so I went to bed.
