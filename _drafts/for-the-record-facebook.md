I joined FB again.

That lasted less than 2 months.  I quit before the post here about a random day in May.

The reasons have to do with the nature of Facebook.  I love my friends, but they post things they need to post.  Posts about the traitor in the White House.  Posts about wearing a mask in this age of pandemic.  Posts about the shitty thing that happened to them recently.  I don't mind the posts about going somewhere to see/do something.
