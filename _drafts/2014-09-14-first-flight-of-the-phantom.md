Two months ago I bought a drone. More accurately, an Umannned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV). In this case, it is a [DJI Phantom 2 Video+][] [quadcopter][].
This thing is about the size of a dinner plate without the propellers, it has
a built-in camera on a stabilizing gimbal capable of 14 Megapixel stills, and
1080p/30 video. The stills come out in Adobe's DNG RAW format, which I
thought was interesting.

The camera is good, tho not great by any stretch
of the imagination. DJI sells a Phantom with a different gimbal designed
to take a stand-alone GoPro camera. I didn't get that one, because I had
questions about some of the details and the cost with the GoPro was higher by
a few hundred. I was concerned about what it took to get the GoPro to
work in a "first person video" (FPV) mode where you fly the 'copter by watching
the video coming from it. I suspect that sooner or later, I will change
the Vision+ camera and gimbal out for the GoPro version.

Last weekend I flew the thing for the first time. I have two batteries, each
good for about 20 minutes of flight time, and I used them both up. I
remembered to turn on the video for some of both of those flights. Over
the last week, I managed to cut those videos into clips and put those clips
into a movie.

Everything about this video was a first: First flight of my first UAV.
First attempts at using iMovie and Final Cut Pro. First time I've ever had
a YouTube account, and first video uploaded to it. The results aren't great,
but they certainly aren't something I could have gotten any other way.
Next time, I'll pay attention to the camera settings a little more. This
time I just wanted to get it flying. I think there is a not-so-wide-angle
setting, and I might see if I can lower the exposure, which bordered on overexposed
at times. There is also some video distortion in the form of noise bands
when the camera was facing towards the sun. There are reports that the
camera is way better if you can get a 2x neutral density filter on it.
That's on the list of things to do.

Apple's [iMovie][] turned
out to be not even sorta intuitive. I struggled with it for 2 days until a
friend suggested I try [Final Cut Pro X][]
trial version, and see if that worked any better. It did, a little.
Both enforce this "event" idea that makes no sense to me at all. I just
wanted to see the two videos I had, be able to dice them up into clips, and then
assemble the clips into a movie. None of this worked like I would have
thought in either product. I'll check to see if there's an Adobe Premier
trial version.
