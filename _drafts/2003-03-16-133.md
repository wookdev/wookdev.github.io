It is often the simple pleasures that are best.  And I've found a new one.  I bought a cross-cut shredder recently, to do away with all my old bills, checks, and assorted stuff that has personal information on it.  It even does credit cards.  I didn't get the one that does CDs too.  Though I do have some things on CD that I probably shouldn't let get out.

I was surprised by how satisfying shredding a document can be.  You stick the paper in the slot, and the machine comes to life, spitting little two-inch-long shreds of paper an eighth of an inch wide into the basket.  I spent an hour the day I bought it shredding a pile of junk mail.  Nothing personal was in that pile, but I was having to much fun.  My shredder isn't very good, so I have to keep stopping to let it cool down.  The shreds aren't supposed to be coming out of the machine in flames.

This little voice in my head keeps telling me to save the shreds for a party or something.  Confetti.  But I know I'd probably never use it, even if I thought I could get out of having to clean up afterwards.

Soon, I shall go through and shred a bunch of old canceled checks that are like 10 years old.
