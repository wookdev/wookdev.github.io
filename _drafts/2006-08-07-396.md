Stolen from somewhere, no doubt.  Comes to me via my friends Al and Diane, who said they got it from our friend Mandy. No word on where she got it.

It goes:

Some people are like a <a href="http://www.poof-slinky.com/" title="Poof-Slinky">Slinky</a>.

Totally useless, but they bring a smile to your face when you push them down a flight of stairs.

Hmmmm... where did I get that?  I can't remember if I got it from my friend Jill or off my Wild Women Sayings Calendar.  I will have to ponder. But the saying still makes me smile. :-D<br />
