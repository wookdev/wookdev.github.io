Ever have one of those weeks when nothing you did made you feel like you ever
did anything all week? I've had one of those weekends. I was going to clear
space for the new aquarium, and while I have made a very large amount of space,
most of the cleared space was NOT in the living room, where the tank is going
to go.

Big meeting at work tomorrow and Tuesday. A customer we really want to get.
Big plans afoot.

May 2nd. Vacation. DemiCon. Vegas. And N+I in the middle of it all. I almost
called Dave today, just to say &quot;Vegas&quot; to him, and hang up. But I
didn't.

My Civ habit has caused me a problem. I had a slow game going (lots of waiting
for automatic moves to finish), and was noodling around with The Sims during
the waiting. Then I realized that I was playing The Sims, and ignoring Civ.
I have given this year of my life to Civ III, so I can't let this happen.

Some rain again yesterday. I thought I heard more thunder today, this morning,
but I saw no evidence of any rain when I went out today. Still in a drought
in NYC. Emergency measures and all that.

I added Led Zeppelin and some other things to iTunes, to go into the iPod.
