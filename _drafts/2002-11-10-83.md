Just a quick update. Went to Des Moines yesterday to play pitch with Al and
Diane, Jaime, Lewis, and Tammy. Much fun was had by all.

Oh, and I had Felix and Oscar's pizza. Yum!

On the way back tonight (Sunday), flying out of O'Hare, the plane developed
a &quot;fuel warning indicator&quot;. So we had to turn around and go back to
O'Hare for a new plane. Means I got home at 1, rather than 10:30. But, that
just means I had more time to talk to the Rockette in the seat next to me.

On the way into O'Hare from DSM, the captain landed the plane very badly, then
came on the intercom and apologized for making the worst landing in his career,
and asked our forgiveness. I told him on the way out that any landing where
we didn't have to walk to the gate from the runway was something I can forgive
him for.
