News on the family front, from Dad:
<blockquote>
This is just a quick note to let you all know that Erin delivered a healthy
baby girl at approximately 4:45 a.m. today.
</blockquote>

Erin in my oldest sister.

No name or other details yet. More when I know. Rudy, Erin, and baby Espino
are all reported to be doing fine.

As an interesting note, this makes my brother a new uncle. I'm going to have
to teach him the ropes of uncledom. (Unclehood? Uncling?)
