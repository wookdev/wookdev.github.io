I was standing by a door on the subway last night, while coming home.  The subway out here in my part of Queens is elevated, and runs down 31st Street.  So when you are looking down out the windows, you can see into people's front yards (such as they are), and often right into their homes too.

Yesterday, somewhere between the 39th and 36th Avenue stops, was a woman sitting on her stoop smoking what looked like a hooka.  Looked like a genie bottle, with two hoses coming out the top, and she had one of the hoses in her mouth, and then blew some smoke.  You don't see that often, even in this international city.  This would be the first time I've seen a hooka anywhere other than TV.

Not in and of itself an interesting sighting, but a nice little distraction from the boredom of travelling home last night.

Hey Wook. if you haven't seen to many hooka smokers .. thats becuase your looking in the wrong place. In Queens go to stienway st and all up and down it you'll find a whole lot of hooka bars, and stores realting to the sale of hooka pipes. I myself go to one of these bars, and it's only one of the 4 or more on the block. So basiaclly what I'm saying is that.. hooka is being smoked out there. you just have to know where to look
