Turns out my old cell phone suffered a major something-or-other over the weekend.
It refused to turn on this morning, despite trying three different batteries
and having it plugged in. It worked Friday night when I got home. 

This is the end of an era. That phone was the original CDMA Motorola StarTac,
from three years ago. If it had lasted just two more weeks, it would have actually
been three years old. I bought it the first week I started RiverSoft. It has
been my constant companion, more or less, ever since.

 So I've replaced it with a <a href="http://www1.sprintpcs.com/explore/PhonesAccessories/PhoneDetails.jsp?selectSkuId=tp5250">LG
TP 5250 from Sprint</a>. It has lots of capabilities I'll never use, but it
is the smallest flip-phone Sprint sells right now, and it is dual band.

Dual band means that in addition to using it on "All digital, PCS networks",
I can use it on "old time", analog, cell phone networks. This is good,
because it means that my phone can select an analog cell network by "roaming",
and then Sprint can charge me 2 dollars a minute for "analog airtime"
that I'm not aware I'm using.

There is a digital-only phone very similar to this one, the TP 1100, for $80
less than the one I got. I didn't get it despite fully intending to when I set
out for the Sprint store in my neighborhood. Somewhere between here and the
Sprint PCs store (Steinway St., 10 blocks away) I decided that dual band was
good. I'm actually impresses with how much coverage Sprint has managed to put
up. Most interstate freeways I've driven lately have had reasonable digital
coverage. Yosemite National Park was one of the few places lately that I didn't
have a PCs signal, and that was a good thing.

I set up the phone so it won't actually "roam" onto such high-cost
(for me) analog networks unless I tell it to. I've heard of problems where even
though Sprint has fully digital PCs coverage, for some reason the phone will
select the analog service anyway.

Never mind that wireless web thing. I'm not sure I'll use it. Maybe for airline
flight information, so I start being angry about a canceled flight just as soon
as humanly possible.

Watched TV all night. I wasn't aware of all the 6 month 9/11 commemorative
stuff going on downtown, or I'd have gone. Going to go see the lights downtown
tomorrow or the night after.

Dug up more info on the differences between US and UK cost-wise. Nothing overly
useful though.

FreshMeat is still not reachable.

Started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380708213/">"The
Forever War" by Joe Haldeman</a>. This is "the definitive version",
with material that got chopped out of the Hugo and Nebula award versions. I'm
reading it because I purchased it recently (having lost my previous copy somewhere).
Be interesting to see if I can tell what got added/changed.

If you do not know of "The Forever War", you might like it. It is
definitely a post-Viet Nam kind of thing. You can find a bunch of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=forever%2Bwar">links
to assorted reviews on Google</a>, none of which I've read. (I have the book
already, why should I read reviews?)

Just found out that the password for this web site is something I don't know
any more. I can still get in with ssh (I really love ssh), but you have to have
the old password to change it to a new one. I remember changing it. I remember
remembering it. I should know better. But if I did know better, then I'd probably
have remembered the damn password in the first place.
