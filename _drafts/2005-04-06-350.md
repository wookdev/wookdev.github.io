I'm in St. Louis this week.  I flew down Monday afternoon, thru <a href="http://www.chicago-ord.com/" title="Chicao O'Hare International Airport">Chicago</a>, on <a href="http://www.united.com" title="United Airlines">United</a>.  This is just notable because <a href="http://www.aa.com./" title="American Airlines">American Airlines</a> practically owns <a href="http://www.lambert-stlouis.com/" title="Lambert St. Louies International Airport">Lambert Field</a>.  They got it when they purchased <a href="http://www.aa.com./" title="American Airlines">TWA</a>.

I'd forgotten that this city isn't a favorite of mine.

To state the positive, the downtown Hilton hotel is all of 2 weeks old at this point.  It is a nice hotel, though my room was rather seriously on the small side.  After the first night, I moved to the Omni Magistic hotel, which is a smaller hotel, and a little older, but has been decent so far.  My room was again, rather small, but other's rooms were larger than mine.

In this, it has been a much better trip than any of my previous ones.  The only time I really enjoyed myself on any previous trip, I visited my friends Mark and Steph in Rolla, MO, which is an hour outside St. Louis.

Why is St. Louis still not a place I would choose to go to?  I haven't run across anything so far to bring me back.  I'm downtown, and there is very little to do down here.  It is a clasic "roll up the sidewalks at 6pm kind of thing.  There might be intesting stuff to do here, but I haven't seen any of it.  Hell, my father and a bunch of friends think St. Louis is lots of fun.

I wish I could see that St. Louis.  Mostly what I see is just no big deal.
