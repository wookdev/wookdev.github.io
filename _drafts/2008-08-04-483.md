The upgrade is done, and once I figured out what buttons to push where and when, it even seems to be working okay so far.

You shouldn't see anything new, as a reader. It is hugely different for me, and has proven to be confusing. For instance, you save entries, or changes to them, via the "Save" button. Not the "Write Entry" button, which does something else, but saving isn't one of them.

Now maybe I'll get around to doing the format update I want to do. Maybe.
