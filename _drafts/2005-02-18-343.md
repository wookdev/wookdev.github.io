EverQuest II, the next generation of a game commonly called "EverCrack" for its ability to pull people in so completely they loose touch with the outside world, is starting to enter that area where I'd call them "a dealer".

This is for real, it would seem.

In EverQuest, many commands are activated by typing the command after a slash.  Thus the command "/who" will show you information about all the people near you.  Sony Online Entertainment ("SOE") has added a /pizza command that will launch a web browser directly to Pizza Hut's order page.

Just for the record, I do not play EverQuest II.

<blockquote>
Well at least the Evercrackers won't go hungry and fade away.  This makes them get up and go to the door to get the food.  Ooooo! Actual exercise.  Walking and an award at the end. Almost like a rat in a maze. OR an extention of Everquest... You must fight your way to the door through the pizza boxes that are threatening to fall on you as you go by, haggle a price with your coins and fight your way back to the keyboard... Why fighting off your kids and spouse from the food, that you are ignoring because you are an Evercracker. Makes perfect sense.
