title: "Turkey Nuts"

I maintain a mailing list for my mother's side of the family.  One of the odd-ball uses we found for it was a Question of the Week.  We haven't done a QOTW for a while, but then today I got this email from my uncle Ken:
<blockquote>
Time for a more sophisticated QOTW from a real adult.</q>

Yup - this is really a question from my mother - believe it or not.</q>

She claims that Louis, her late second husband, a former turkey rancher, told her years ago that there is a "sophisticated, gourmet" name for turkey nuts, and yes I DO mean turkey nuts. None of us ever heard of it. It's kinda like snails are called "escargot".</q>

Apparently Louis used to go to a turkey convention every year and turkey nuts were considered a real delicacy there, but they had a more sophisticated name. Mom actually tried some while here in California with Louis years ago. They were called turkey nuts.</q>

Mom insisted that I solicit an answer from all you pros out there. Good luck looking THAT up on Google or elsewhere.</q>

In case there is no real answer (go figure) we encourage some imaginative answers, perhaps even some frivilous humor.</q>

Some already mentioned possibilities are turkey "Gems", turkey "Jewels", and the most popular - "turkey balls". Somehow I doubt that they qualify as the "gourmet" expression of delicacy.</q>

Really - she insisted I do this.</q>

I gotta go home for dinner now.....Bye</q>

Google is of course, all powerfull (All hail Google!), and I was bored, so read on for what I found.

Give the lady a hand, folks... just wash it first.

There is in fact a culinary term for turkey nuts, and that term is "Animelles", a french word for "testicle".  I could be wrong, but I found this word on a site about turkey nuts.

<a href="http://www.psgrill.net/Encyclopedia/ENCYCLOPEDIA.html">This site</a> says:
<dl>
<dt><b>animelles</b> (Fr.)</dt>
<dd>The culinary term for testicles of animals, especially rams; animelles are less popular in Europe today than formerly but still common in the Middle East; in Italy, animelle means sweetbreads.</dd>
</dl>

I also have to include the definition from <a href="http://www.hoboes.com/html/Diner/oysters.shtml">this site</a>:
<dl>
<dt><b>Animelles</b>: (U.S. fry)</dt>
<dd>Culinary term for the testicles of male animals, in particular those of lambs and sheep. In the past animelles were very much in vogue in France, Spain, and Italy.</dd>
</dl>

I included it so I can wonder out loud what the testicles of <strong>female</strong> animals might be called?

From <a href="http://www.funlinked.com/testicle/fact.html">these people</a> we find:
<blockquote>
The Euphemisms

A testicle by any other name...
<ul>
<li>fry (lamb, calf, turkey, rooster, pig, bull, etc.)</li>
<li>rocky mountain oysters</li>
<li>Montana tendergroin</li>
<li>bulls jewels</li>
<li>barnyard jewels</li>
<li>cowboy caviar</li>
<li>farm oysters</li>
<li>swinging beef</li>
<li>Animelles - fr. (testicles)</li>
<li>bollocks</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

I like the third from the bottom best.

I'd also rather not bring to your attention (but I can't help myself):
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.turkey-testicle-festival.com/index.html" title=" Turkey Testicle Festival Official Site">http://www.turkey-testicle-festival.com/index.html</a>
</blockquote>

Yes, you read that right, this is a turkey testicle festival.  Nobody under 21 allowed in, for no reason I could determine from the site itself.  There are quite a few festivals surrounding eating testicles in general, but this was the only one I found in my short and incomplete search specifically to turkey gonads.  They even have a turkey testicle song.
