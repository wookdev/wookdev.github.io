My Squarespace subscription is up towards the end of April. So I'm playing around
with it to see if I want to stick around here. The new template is called "Native".
It is cleaner than the old "Bedford" template, but still obviously way more focused
on the visuals than I feel Munged.Org needs to be. Pictures can go up over on
[WookPhoto][].

Some things that Squarespace made easy: The [gallery of DC25 photos][]
was pretty easy to put up and looked good. Adding any pictures has been pretty easy,
and includes basic photo editing controls to make them look like I want. Easy
integration to YouTube and Vimeo videos for the Phantom. But it isn't perfect.
The link tool will show some of the content of this site to link to, but not
blog pages. I had to save this as draft, go find the link to the DC25 gallery,
then edit this file again to paste it in. Hope it works the way I formatting
the link. **Edit:** Nope!

Where else would I go?

I'm [currently testing][] moving the site over to [GitHub Pages][]. It also has some
interesting implications about security and accessibility that may be considered
"features", or not. For one thing, because I'm not paying for Github,
the source of the site is in a [public repository][]. Everything is visible: page templates and
formatting code, plus the content source.

This means that all y'all could clone the repo, fix things, and send me pull
requests to include your fixes on my site. What would you change? Spelling.
Formatting. Site changes. Fact checking. Adding interesting links. Whatever
you are willing to spend the time to do to make the site better. It is my option
to include any changes, but it is an interesting idea.

There's also an issue tracker I'm using to remind myself of things I want to do,
and a wiki that can be used for off-site collaboration. The wiki is intended for
documentation, and I have to admit the idea of my blog having "documentation"
amuses me.

The downside is that it isn't really easier than Squarespace. The repository has
to be cloned to my computers, and edited locally. Changes are version controlled,
which is nice, but live locally until synced with the main repo on GitHub. If I
forget to sync, I could take the laptop and not have the most recent changes that
live on the desk machine.

I'm using GitHub and git, for the first time, so still kind of feeling my way
along. I [GPG][] signed a tag (version release)
last night at a completely inappropriate spot in the development of the site for
example. Tho really, that was just to see what it looked like. I might, once I get
everything the way I want it, blow away the repo and re-create it from files saved
locally.

If I move over there, I'll make sure to import all the posts from here as well.
There aren't that many posts here, it will be easy. I might, if I end up with the
energy and interest, import the really old site from the Moveable Type days.
Sadly, the WordPress site is gone. But there wasn't much there anyway.

It is very interesting, but will kind of be a lot of work for nothing if I
stay here. Them's the breaks, I guess. Or maybe I'll give [Textpattern][]
a try again.
