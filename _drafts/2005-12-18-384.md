I was on the subway, N train, into The City last night to hang with Enzo.  During the ride, a dude got on the subway at 5th Avenue, and around about 57th Street, started offering everyone within earshot <span class="really">the perfect job:</span> Stay on the train, and wake him up at 3:00 AM.

He was even willing to be generous too.  He was offering 2 dollars, tax free no less, for this service.  And he promised to double it if you got him awake at exactly 3:00 AM, not a minute early or late.  I do not know if anyone grabbed this opportunity, but he did not have any taker by the time I got off at 23rd street.

It is a wonder than anyone needs to be homeless in this city, with these kind of opportunities for employment.  You just need to keep your eyes open.
