As the story is told to me, the last time anyone saw Paul Clites was June 18th or so.  After not hearing from him for a couple of weeks, Dave McLaughlin got worried about him, and started asking around.  Nobody else had seen him either, and they were worried about him too.  Dave called the police, who interviewed some neighbors, and then had a locksmith open the door to Paul's home.

Paul was found dead, in his home, July 3rd, 2003.

When ever I was in Des Moines, and met Paul for the first time in any visit, he would see me across the room and in an cheerful voice call out "It's a Wookie!".  It had never even occurred to me that I would miss that, but I do already.  Hugely.

Paul's chosen epitaph is "The Caped Avenger Hurts Himself".  Paul was a uniquely funny guy, very smart, and interesting to be around.  He was involved in <a href="http://www.demicon.org/">DemiCon</a> always, and was a regular in <a href="http://www.trans-iowa.org/">TICC</a> plays.</a>

I don't think I'll be able to make Paul's memorial service, which is Saturday the 12th in Des Moines.  But I wish I could, Paul was a friend.

We wish you were here too for the memorial but I bet you can still hear Paul say "It's a Wookie!" in your heart, mind and soul.  Means he will never truly be gone.

I am Paul's sister. I am profoundly grateful to all of his friends for the comments at his memorial service. They allowed me to know Paul as an adult. I knew him as a child and had only sporadic contact with him as an adult, so I cherished the stories of Paul's wit, antics, compassion and loyalty as a friend to all of you. I am glad he had you and I am glad you had him. I will miss him deeply and will always regret that I was unable to be closer to him, but I respected his desire for privacy and understand the reasons behind it. I didn't love him any less because of it. Thank you all for caring so much.
