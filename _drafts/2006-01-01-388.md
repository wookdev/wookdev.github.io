I'm in Des Moines this weekend for the annual 3 day new year's eve party.  Formally a party thrown by and for <a href="http://www.dmsfs.org/" title="Des Moines Science Fiction Society">DMSFS</a>, and called the Semi-Annual Constitutional Convention.  A bunch of us get together at the Roth Hotel and Convention  Center, and socialize for a weekend.  This year, the party was from Friday night to Sunday night.  Or maybe Monday morning.

As usual, I've been taking snapshots.  You can find the snapshots <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/dmsfs-sacc/">on Flickr</a>.
