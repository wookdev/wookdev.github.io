<a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/prozak" title="Prozak for Lovers">A band</a>, or act maybe, so named because you'll need some to stop laughing at this CD.

The tracking goes as follows:

1. Proud Mary
1. Pump It Up
1. Aqualung
1. Love Will Tear Up Apart
1. (Don't Fear) The Reaper
1. Message of Love
1. I Wanna Be Sedated
1. London Calling
1. Rebel Rebel
1. Folsom Prison Blues

I hear you asking: "So? Lots of people have covered these tunes."

Yes, but most don't do them as sleepy lounge numbers.  I'm listening to the preview tracks right now.  I think I peed my pants laughing somewhere during "I Wanna Be Sedated".

So, check out <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/" title="CD Baby">CD Baby</a>, where I found this.  I'd like to thank my brother for sending me the link.
