<a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/prozak" title="Prozak for Lovers">A band</a>, or act maybe, so named because you'll need some to stop laughing at this CD.

The tracking goes as follows:
<ol>
<li>Proud Mary</li>
<li>Pump It Up</li>
<li>Aqualung</li>
<li>Love Will Tear Up Apart</li>
<li>(Don't Fear) The Reaper</li>
<li>Message of Love</li>
<li>I Wanna Be Sedated</li>
<li>London Calling</li>
<li>Rebel Rebel</li>
<li>Rolsom Prison Blues</li>
</ol>

I hear you asking: "So? Lots of people have covered these tunes."

Yes, but most don't do them as sleepy lounge numbers.  I'm listening to the preview tracks right now.  I think I peed my pants laughing somewhere during "I Wanna Be Sedated".

So, check out <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/" title="CD Baby">CD Baby</a>, where I found this.  I'd like to thank my brother for sending me the link.

Speaking of links, and not remembering your e-mail addr. I've found a new news (kinda) website that I think you'll like, but chances are you (being the web guru that we all know you are) have already seen it, but anyway::
