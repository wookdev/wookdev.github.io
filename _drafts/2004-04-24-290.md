It is gorgeous outside on this Saturday afternoon, here in New York city.  If I was smart, I'd be out with the camera.  But I'm not smart.  Or maybe to smart.  I have things that I have to do before <a href="http://www.demicon.org">DemiCon</a> next weekend.  They are things I won't get done during the week, because of this "work" thing.

So here I sit, in front of the computer, making sure that I have a photo processing workflow in order, working good, and transfered over to the laptop.  I also have to check the studio lights out, and get them repaired.  Getting to B&H to get a softbox would be a good thing too.

It will be worth it, but I wish I was less smart so I could go out and get some sun.

Maybe just for an hour or two....
