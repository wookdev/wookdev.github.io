I say we send him first.

My mother came up with this first, actually.  This is one of the reasons I love the woman dearly.  The email she sent was about other things, but finished with:
<blockquote>Signing off as the person who would like to send GB, Jr.  to the moon.</blockquote>

So I figure she should get credit.
