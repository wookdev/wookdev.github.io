Go check out Downtown Thai in downtown on W. 4th Street. I just had thee best Thai chicken soup I've ever tasted anywhere there. It is right around the corner from the downtown Marriott, the hotel I'll be trying to get into for the rest of my stay.

Monday's sports section in the local paper had approx 2 pages, out of 6, about NASCAR. My customer sponsors Jimmy Johnson, and his and his car's photos are everywhere. His number, 48, figures prominently in every password I've been given so far.

The coolest looking building in town, and one of the more distinctive ones anywhere, is the "RJR Building".

I also went to Wilksboro this morning. I've been told horror stories about that town, but I wasn't there long enough to verify any of them. It could be entirely rural stereotype. I will say that the drive into town was along a road where about 25% of homes were on wheels. I have been threatened with being taken to eat at "Ted's Kickin' Chicken" (might not be how Ted spelled the name). The food is supposed to be good, but I'm told it can be intimidating if you aren't into rusted-out pickup trucks with gun racks (full gun racks) in them. I'm looking forward to it, actually.
