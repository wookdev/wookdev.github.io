I went to <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/">B&amp;H Photo</a> today. I'm
not sure if I've mentioned this place before. If you are into photography, video,
or sound, then you should visit this place. It's HUGE. They have EVERYTHING.

Anywho. I went there to develop some film. I figured I'd see how they do.

But, whereas I was really good the last (first) time I was there, this time
I didn't get away so lucky. Wookie was very bad.

<a href="http://www.contaxcameras.com/tseries/t3body.html"><img src="/pix/contax-t3.gif" alt="Contax T3" name="contaxt3" width="115" height="90" border="0" align="right" id="contaxt3"></a>Yes,
I bought another camera. A <a href="http://www.contaxcameras.com/tseries/t3body.html">Contax
T3</a>. This is a 35mm point and shoot camera. It has a 35mm/f2.8 lens made
by Carl Zeiss, a highly respected German lens maker. It is also small enough
to fit in a (large) pocket. I plan on carrying it everywhere, though maybe not
in my pocket.

Why? Why would I buy yet another camera, when I haven't totally gotten the
first one figured out yet?

This camera I can carry around with me. The N80 is a little large for that
kind of thing. The whole Nikon kit so far fits in a bag you could stuff a cat
into if you tried really hard and it was in a REALLY patient mood. (Which is
to say that the bag isn't actually the size of a cat, but you might be able
to shoehorn one into it.)

I wander around saying to myself &quot;I want that picture&quot;. Now I can
get it.

...I need to get a more reasonable camera bag for the N80...

In other news: I cleaned my bathroom. Now my apartment smells like a swimming
pool.

I tried the new restaurant that replaced Lemonia. Lemonia was around the corner
on 30th Street, on my way to the subway. Lemonia was the best gyro in the city.
I loved the place, even though I wouldn't go near the place for the first 5
years I lived here. It was truly a hole in the wall, emphasis on &quot;hole&quot;.
I loved the place. Then one day, a whole bunch of young kids showed up, replacing
the old farts that had been there before. Then it closed, and was remodeled
into the &quot;nicer&quot; place it is now.

The new place isn't as good. I miss a great gyro sandwich.

So I'm listening to one of the Moby songs I ripped into iTunes on the Mac.
The process of ripping and encoding as an MP3 file didn't work very well for
this one track. It has a roaring sound in quiet spaces after louder spots. A
fine example of why MP3s are not good for high fidelity audio reproduction.
Have to see if I can re-rip it and get something listenable.

Well, RiverSoft is not yet actually owned by Micromuse, but the deal is &quot;unconditional&quot;.
90.8% of all stock voted for the sale. Being unconditional means that Muse will
buy RiverSoft, and that there is nothing that can stop the deal at this point.
So they don't own us yet, but they might as well.

The part that really honks me, is that while all my options where under water,
or &quot;out of the money&quot; as Tim the CEO kept saying, there might be people
who started after the IPO who got options at a more reasonable strike price.
This shouldn't bother me. I have no proof. Buy I can't get it out of my head.
