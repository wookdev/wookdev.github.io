Hair doesn't stop growing.  It just keeps on getting longer.  After a hair has grown for a while, the hair folicle gets pushed out by a new hair folicle.  So while hair is always growing, it does reach a maximum length.

I think my hair is as long as it's going to get.  Not all of it is that length yet, but I think I've reached some kind of limit.

I'm kinda bummed.

Ah when one hair can clog a drain... I think the person's hair is too long. But hey it's your drain.  You can plunger your drains all you want.

Actually I snake them.  And I have yet to find just one hair clogging on drain up all by itself.  It takes at least 3.
