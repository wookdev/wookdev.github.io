My phone doesn't work.  Again.

This happens a couple of times a year it seems.  Suddenly, no dialtone.  People who call me just get ringing.

My new year's resolution, starting now: I'm going to make the frikken phone computer fix it this time.  I promise myself.

Well, the story is I have one because I've always had one.  I keep it, because it is more reliable than my internet service.  Except it ISN'T more reliable than my internet service.

Oh well, this is today's project.
