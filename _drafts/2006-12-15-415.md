title: "My EMC|SMARTS Laptop - 8 Weeks Later"
datestr: December 15, 2006

I'm laughing.  I was told this would happen.  I'm not surprised at all, but still for some reason it is funny that I got the email I just got.  My boss at EMC, <a href="http://www.munged.org/saga/402.html">the company I left 8 weeks ago</a>, asked what happened to my corporate laptop.  And if I still had it, could I send it in.

During my exit interview, the HR lady told me that this would happen.  I didn't doubt her, I'd never seen any evidence during my tenure that EMC had a good IT hardware tracking system.  The laptop in question was 4 years old when I gave it back to them, being the only laptop I'd ever had thru SMARTS to EMC|SMARTS.

Since HR knew this would happen, the HR lady (wish I could remember her name) suggested that I have the IT dude, Nick, send her an email saying he'd received from me, one laptop and all the accessories.  I watched him do it.  You would think this would be enough for that laptop to be locatable later.  But I guess not.
