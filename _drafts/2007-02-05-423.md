I went over to the home of my friends Anne and Nat to watch the Superbowl today.  I bought pizza, they provided munchies and drinks.  their son bounced off the walls all night, like any 3-year-old does.  A good time was had by all.

At some time during the night, the subject of Lava Lamps came up, and I expressed a regret in never having owned one.  Nat told me not only did he have one, it was the 3-foot-tall model, and he offered it to me.  They couldn't keep it in the house with the 3-year-old.  What with lava lamps being made of glass and full of strange liquids, I could understand this.

It is now sitting in my bedroom, waiting for a suitable light bulb to power it.  I should have it running tomorrow night.  At that time, I expect women to flock to me, because I own a 3-foot-tall lava lamp.  How can any woman resist me now?

Alas, easily -- you've now provided something in your home that is more attractive to women than you.  I say ditch the lamp and get a tattoo of one...

You also, of course, need a USB Lava Lamp...
