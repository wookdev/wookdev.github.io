We all knew this anyway, right?  But here is the mathematical proof.

Ah Wookie, this would explain why you don't have a girlfriend.  You might think we are evil, maybe even say it but don't write it down. First rule of being evil don't leave evidence. We can use it against you... later...over and over.. never stopping... until there is nothing left.  MWMAHHHHHHHHH!

Alas the answer is still the same.  Thank you but nope. My evilness is given to one person at this time and he seems to enjoy the torment I do to him very much as it is. So the position is still very much taken.  But there is many other evil ones out there that would enjoy your offer.  MWaahhhHHHHHHH! ;-D

Ah well, just goes to show that all the good ones are taken. 

Have any friends like you?

Another one like me? Unheard of. There can be only one evil genius like me . . . but I can look around. You never know what other evilness is out there just around the corner.  When you stop looking, thats is when it attacks, throws you to the floor and chews you up into itty bitty pieces... and you enjoy every minute of it.

Not only are we evil, we know it...and revel in it...so get over it and just enjoy it...you know you want to!

Um, I was.  Or maybe I should say I would like to.  I do know that.  Women may be eeeevil, but that is what I like about them.

And I don't think my expectations are too high.  I just want a woman who is down to earth, cheerfull, has a smile that lights up a room, long hair, caring hands, the face of an angel, the body of a slut, and a cold nose....

No, wait, that last one should have been on a different list.

Those are reasonable expectations, I think.  I can't understand why I can't find what I want.

Men...unreasonable expectations?  Naaaaah...

Dreams are good...keep dreaming, babe, cause that's the only place she exists...

Well crap.

If I have nothing better to look foward too, guess I'll just give up.

Again.

Drat! If only I'd known. And here I went and cut off my long hair. I'm so crushed.

If her hair has to be long I hope not as long as you, otherwise I would say you need to re-evaluate the list.  Actually I know one or two evil ones that just might fit the list...even the cold nose.  But there is a catch (as always) they are very married.  Those being tormented by them grabbed a hold of their evilness, held on and will never let go. Such is life.

D'Oh!

The idea is to deliver onto me the AVAILABLE ONES!  Sheesh, do I have to spell this out!  I'm giving you the chance to select some evil for me, and use your evilness in doing so, but NOOOOOOOOoOOOO....

Ya know, if it wasn't that I'm the kind that likes to try before I buy, I could get one of these via mail order.

On another note, back when my hair was just long, but not like it is now, I used to say that one of the requirements for a GF (girlfriend) was that her hair had to be longer than mine.

I took that one off the list about 3 years ago though...

There are some faces that look better in short hair, and that is cool by me.  But I like long hair, as anyone who knows me has probably figured out by now.
