Here's the promised &quot;news on the job front&quot;.

Tomorrow, I start work with <a href="http://www.smarts.com/">Systems
Management Arts</a>, sometimes called <a href="http://www.smarts.com/">SMARTS</a>.
The &quot;home office&quot; is in White Plains, New York. This is in Westchester
county, the first county north of New York city. I haven't completely got the
commute thing figured out yet, but it is a reverse commute that seems to be
about 40 minutes by Metro North commuter train.

You can follow the ongoing tale, as always, in the <a href="/styles/pola_btmmid.jpg">journal</a>.
