<a href="http://www.terrybisson.com">Terry Bisson</a> is a Science Fiction write who has been around for a while.  Somehow though, I didn't learn of him until this last week.  His web site is pretty standard for an author.  One of the stories on the site, <a href="http://www.terrybisson.com/meat.html">They're Made Out Of Meat"</a> is rather screamingly funny.  Check it out.
