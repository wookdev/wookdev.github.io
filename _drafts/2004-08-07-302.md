title: "DemiCon Photos Soon"
datestr: August 07, 2004

The <a href="http://www.demicon.org/15/" title="DemiCon 15">DemiCon 15</a> photos are all processed.  They aren't all orange, the out of focus photos have been removed, the cleavage shots are set to be in a secret directory, and the Dreamweaver templates are almost done.

Now... If only it was that easy...

Today I uploaded the first test run of all the photos and some test html, and discovered that the web site is full.  The <a href="http://www.demicon.org/15/" title="DemiCon 15">DC15</a> photos will not fit in the space allowed for the web site.

I host the Munged web sites at <a href="http://www.suberb.net/" title="Superb Internet">Superb Internet</a>.  My account allows 500 megabytes of space, which has been so much more than I needed up till now it has been hillarious.  I got this much space because it came with the account that had the database access I needed.  I haven't used more than 100 Meg of it up until this year, because of the glut of photos.  Now, though, it would seem I need more space.

So I'll be working on this next, I guess.  I might be able to take down some photos, but the DC15 photos number 414 this year, and at about 400K a shot, they add up to some space.  More space would be good anyway, since I'll have AnimeIowa CosPlay photos to put here too.

So photos soon.
