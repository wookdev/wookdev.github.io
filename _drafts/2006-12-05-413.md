Steve Wynn built the <a href="http://www.bellagio.com/">Bellagio</a>, and is responsible for the fountains and the collecting the artwork and such. The first time I stayed at Bellagio, I was entranced. The staff was incredibly friendly and willing to talk to me, and they seemed to enjoy working to make my stay enjoyable. It was small things, that they'd smile and be at ease when I made my dumb little requests, and never seemed to be in a hurry to get to the next menial task on their schedule.

The second and third times I stayed at Bellagio, that feeling of comfort was gone. It had gone from being Bellagio to being A Hotel On The Strip in Las Vegas. I found later that Bellagio had been sold to the MGM Grand chain.

Steve Wynn built a new casino hotel/resort just up the strip from The Venetian. Called eponymously, <a href="http://www.wynnlasvegas.com/">Wynn Las Vegas</a>.

The Wynn felt like that Bellagio of that first stay there.

I was staying in a Tower Suite (really just a slightly larger room), rather than in a Resort room, and thus part of this was from being in the higher-class part of the hotel. But I also got this feeling from the public areas, the casino, and the restaurants too. I was talking to one of the massage therapists, a lady that had also worked at Bellagio, and she said one of the big differences was that Wynn liked to have a large staff, and the dude who bought Bellagio from Wynn liked skeleton crews. My impression is that Wynn is good at creating a corporate culture that isn't hugely stressful to the employees, and they transfer that ease of work to all they do. 

One of the seriously cool parts of the Wynn was my pet peeve about casinos in Vegas: The fucking bells, beeps, boops, and sirens of the slot machines. They play muzak in the casino, and you can hear it over the noise of the slots. In fact, I'm hard pressed to say I heard the slots at all, unless I was listening specifically for them. Even when I was playing craps 20 feet from the slots, I don't remember hearing them. On any other stay in Vegas, I'm ready to leave 3 days after arriving, just to escape the damn noise of the slots in the casino. I could have stayed a week in the Wynn. 

My room was big, and very nice. There was a good amount of room to move around, a desk with high-speed internet (which I didn't use) and an Avaya IP phone, a Gateway 34&quot; HD TV with the usual hotel features. The bathroom had two sinks, a makeup table, separate bath and shower stalls, and the toilet was in its own little room with a door and a phone. There was a small TV in the bathroom, tho I never had it on because it wasn't in sync with the HD TV out in the room, which was disconcerting. The bed was one of the nice new ones all the hotels are switching too, that are super-comfortable. It had a down comforter on it too. Getting out of bed was hard.

The restaurants are all first class. I've detailed my experiences with food in the daily diary posts.

The craps tables all had a $15 minimum bet, even when nobody was playing them, which is higher than usual for hotels on the strip. My style of play takes $150 for every 5 dollars of minimum bet, so this is something I consider. However, I was betting green chips ($25), so it wasn't an actual problem. The tables all had dealers that seemed to be having a good time, and I didn't see any tables that stayed quiet for to long. Most importantly, I won at them, which was nice.

I did check out Lure, one of the clubs, but it was dead and the only women in the place were working there. I didn't see any chicks dance on tables, which was the line that got me into the place in the first place.

Physically, the Wynn is located pretty much all the way at the other end of the strip from where I'm used to hanging out. If Madalay Bay and Luxor are at one end of the strip, Wynn is at the other. The only hotels I know of that are farther out are The Sahara, and the Stratosphere. I'm not really interested in either of them.

So, I liked the Wynn a lot, and will be staying there again, I would say. If you get the chance, I'd suggest doing so yourself.
