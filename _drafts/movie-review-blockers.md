We watched [Blockers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2531344/) this morning.  It was funnier than we expected.  Worth a rental fee to see.  We often like comedies that we don't laugh out loud to, but this one we laughed all the way thru it.  Very clever.

I normally hate movies based on horrible people being horrible, and the three parent characters are horrible people.  But the movie is very self-aware that it's main characters are horrible people, and thus (I think) managed to never get my hackles up about it.
