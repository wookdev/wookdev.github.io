<a href="http://www.munged.org/saga/308.html" title="Typewriter?">It</a> was in fact a typewriter.  This I know because the lady carrying it is probably my new massage therapist, and I've seen her use it.

Just in case anyone is keeping track of just how small the world really is.

Hey Wookie!

You found one....a new massage therapist that is.  You'll have to let me know what techniques she uses and if she can get that damn knot out of your back. Toodles.

In keeping with my practice of asking every massage therapist to marry me, I asked.  She said no.  I'm crushed.
