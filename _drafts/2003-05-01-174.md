I took a few days off to be at <a href="http://www.demicon.org">Demicon</a> this year.  So today is a travel day.

I showed up at LGA today, to find that my 1 pm <a href="http://www.ual.com">flight</a> was delayed at least and hour due to a mechanical.  This meant I missed my connection.  So I was on a 2 pm flight, and got to DSM at like 6:30, or two hours later than I planned.

The con was at the <a href="http://www.hotelfortdesmoines.com/">Hotel Fort Des Moines</a>, a historical old hotel that I'd never been to when I lived in Des Moines.  I didn't even really know where it was.  Good thing the hotel shuttle drivers generally are capable of finding their hotels, which is how I got there.  Other than having to hang out in the ORD Red Carpet Club for an extra hour, I'd say that the trip was pleasant overall.

Fortunately, I got there and settled in before the <a href="http://www.trans-iowa.org/">TICC</a> rehearsal started.  I feel guilty about missing the art show setup, but it got set up okay.

I had been so informed, even though I'm not generally fond of being in the play.  Since I can't be in DSM for rehearsals, when they do put me in the play, I mostly walk around, with no clue as to my blocking.  It was mostly the same this time, though I got to wear a bitchin' suit of fake armor as a Jaffa from SG-1.  My hood emblem fell off on my way on stage, but Greg said they made a lot of extras.  The best part was the ticki torches, IMHO.

A few of us ended up eating at Perkins for dinner, at about 11:30 at night.  After that, we all crashed for the night.

I have to wonder about how the lights fared on the trip.  The <a href="http://www.ual.com">airline</a> asked what was in the case when I checked it, and the answer ("studio lights") was good enough for them.  The lights are here in the hotel with me.  Guess I'll find out tomorrow night if the flash tubes are all intact.  I feel okay though, I'm carrying a few spares with me.
