I had a massage scheduled with Mandi today that I spaced off. I came home yesterday
from Minneapolis because I new I had the appointment with her. I got up early
(before noon) because I knew I had an appointment with her. I'm not totally
sure how I lost track of my purpose for the day, but around about 1 pm, I was
working on getting off the phone so I could grab a quick lunch.

Ah well. We rescheduled for tomorrow afternoon.

Went to the <a href="http://www.dmsfs.org/">DMSFS</a> meeting tonight. It was
about what I was expecting it would be. The club is looking to attract new membership,
and they are trying to broaden their appeal, and get more active in the community.
This is a good thing, and they seem to have a really good handle on it. 

They are also working on <a href="http://www.demicon.org/">DemiCon XIV</a>.
I'm looking forward to doing some photography for real at this one.
