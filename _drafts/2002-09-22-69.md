Just got back from seeing &quot; Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever&quot; tonight. It
is an action movie, with good action. Nothing else needs to be said about, or
for, this movie.

Slept the whole day away today. Woke up at 11:30. First time in two weeks that
I've been able to sleep past 7 AM. Course, I didn't get to bed until almost
6 AM.
