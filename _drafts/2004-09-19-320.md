title: "Bo3b Is A Wuss"
datestr: September 19, 2004

I own a t-shirt that says on the front: "Evil keeps me young".

When I go out wearing it, I get grins and nods, and sometimes outright laughter and questions about where I got it.  I got mine at DemiCon back in May.

I ran into my old friend Bo3b at AnimeIowa this weekend while I was wearing it.  He told me that I must give it to him, and that I was not allowed to leave the state alive befor I gave it to him.  Assorted taunts and insults were traded.

Well, I'm here, at home, in New York City, with the shirt, to say the following:
<blockquote class="reallyreallyreally">Bo3b is a pussy! Nya!</blockquote>

Ah I think Sheril would disagree... or there are things about Bo3b that we don't know and do not want to know.

I think you are missing the spirit of name calling that I'm working on here.

Nah!  But at least be correct in your name calling gender- wise.

Gender-wise?  Where I come from, "pansy" was just another word for "wuss".
