There is an oft seen public service poster on the Metro North trains saying that assaulting or killing train operators and conductors carries the same penalty as killing cops.  The implication seems to be that assaulting or killing cops has stiffer punishments than if you assault or kill a, um, "civilian".

Since when is one person's life "more important" than any other person's life?

And does anyone really think that a murderer actually chooses (when they do choose) who to kill based on the prison term they might get?  I mean, really?
