Okay, this one is just for you Mac OS X people out there.

<a href="http://meta.ath0.com/">This guy</a> has been working on a screen saver based on <a href="http://www.thematrix.com">The Matrix</a> code <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/m1_screensaver_index.html">screen-savers</a>.  It is called <a href="http://meta.ath0.com/software/redpill/">Red Pill</a>.  I don't remember the code of the <a href="http://www.matrixreloaded.com/">Matrix</a> looking 3D, but this screen saver is VERY COOL.  (Though I have yet to see "Matrix Reloaded".)  I don't usually run screen savers, prefering instead to use power management to blank the screen.  But I sometimes activate this one, just to watch it.

Give it a shot.
