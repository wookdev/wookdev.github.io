Just got back from some business in Charleston, South Carolina.  Enjoyed my time there.  I didn't really see anything, except for a big purple plume of smoke come from the direction of the air force base near the airport on landing, but still, it was a nice time.  My one notable thing from the trip was the jambalaya from the Marina Variety Store (a restaraunt, and damn good one) at the City Marina.  There was other good food too.  Seafood is as good there, if not better, than any other coastal city I've been to.  And this coastal city understands BBQ.
