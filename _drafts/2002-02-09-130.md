title: "My iMac's Role In Life"

Well, I upgraded my iMac to Mac X a couple weeks ago. I was going
to write about what I thought about it. And I thought I had a good start going
too, until I finished and <a href="/imho/iMac.html">this is the article</a>
that came out. Mac X isn't mentioned until the very end, and almost in apology.
Not one of my better efforts, but what the hell. 

My thought on OS X will be written down. I also have a
new iPod that I might say a few things about too.
