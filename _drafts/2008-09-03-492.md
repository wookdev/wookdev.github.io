I found this in my iChat window today, from my friend Meg.  It made me laugh at a time I was in a foul mood and needed a laugh.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="meg-aim.png" src="http://www.munged.org/saga/meg-aim.png" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="362" width="355" /></span>

Other than the joke here, I'm always "Away" or some variation, all the time.  I don't set iChat to "Available" any more because I'm not good at remembering to set it back away when I leave the computer.  I figure being perpetually away and will sometimes answer is better than being always available but never responding.  So my friends have learned to just poke my cage and see if I stir.  Meg just did it creatively.
