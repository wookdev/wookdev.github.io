When some guardian angel reads a magazine, a secretly surly ribbon self-flagellates. If the alchemist living with a guardian angel hosts a looking glass, then the menag� � trois over the cigar flies into a rage. Lila and I took a bubble bath (with a surly looking glass, the dahlia, a few toothaches, and a slovenly bubble) to arrive at a state of intimacy where we can overwhelmingly trade baseball cards with our tenor. Scheherazade, the friend of Kafka and Mitzi, hides with an omphalos.

 The main theme of the works of Burroughs is not, in fact, appropriation, but subappropriation. In a sense, the capitalist paradigm of reality suggests that art may be used to reinforce sexism. In <em>Port of Saints</em>, Burroughs deconstructs postcapitalist discourse; in <em>Naked Lunch</em> he denies the capitalist paradigm of reality.

Every now and then, you run across a web site talking about site design or page layout where the example pages have lots of text that makes no sense.  This is a professional design technique, it turns out.  People evaluating the design of a page will get distracted by the text content of that page.  So &quot;Lorem Ipsum&quot;, which is 500 year old gobbledygook, is used to make real looking text that is meaningless.

Tonight, because I am redesigning this site, I thought I'd look for some way of including Lorem Ipsum in the design templates.  So I typed in &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=random+text+generator" title="Google Search: Randon Text Generator">random text generator</a>&quot; into Google.  I didn't know what Lorem Ipsum was at the time.  I found that I'd gotten lucky.

The first paragraph above was created by the Lorem Ipsum generator at <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/" title="Lorem Ipsum">Lorem Ipsum</a>.  That site also has the history of Lorem Ipsum.  It is a short, interesting read.

The second paragraph above was created by the <a href="http://www.anotherlongsleeplessnight.com/projects/deluxe.html" title="A random text generator for the innocent, the eager, and the doomed">Deluxe Transitive Generator</a> by <a href="http://www.anotherlongsleeplessnight.com/" title="http://www.anotherlongsleeplessnight.com">Eric Jacobsen</a>.

The third paragraph might look real, but it isn't. It comse from the <a href="http://www.elsewhere.org/cgi-bin/postmodern/" title="Postmodernism Generator">Postmodernism Generator</a>, which is incredibly hillarious.  It is writen by <a href="http://dev.null.org/acb/" title="acb">Andrew C. Bulhak</a> with the <a href="http://dev.null.org/dadaengine/" title="also writen by acb">Dada Engine</a>.

The Google search that started this actually turned out to be one of the more interesting sets of search results I've run across in a while.  Thus, I've imortalized it here.
