title: "Skid Marks on my Brain!!!"

Rule 1: Never change from Aerosmith and AC/DC to 3 Dog Night. Going the other
way is probably okay, but don't do what I just did. I think I have skid marks
on my brain.

What a week.

RiverSoft gave us all implicit permission to work on our resumes at work. We got a
message telling us we should update our resumes with RiverSoft info and forward
them to the company secretary, so that &quot;we can be represented in the strongest
possible light to MicroMuse&quot;, or something to that effect. So maybe we
don't even get to apply for our own jobs; RiverSoft will do it for us. Mine
is of course ready. I just moved some stuff around, PDF'ed it, and sent it in.
Interesting to see what happens next.

Howard quit RiverSoft. He gave his notice Tuesday. In the opinion of the Veep
of NA Sales, he is going to a competitor. So he was &quot;walked out&quot; today,
even though he was on an airplane at the time. Good trick that.
