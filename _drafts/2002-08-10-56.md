Been a quiet day. Got up and took my laundry in. Had some pizza from Sac's
Place on the corner. Watched Dennis Miller Live on the TiVo, as well as a couple
of Samurai Jack and PPG. Fell asleep for an hour. Now I'm cleaning up my email,
listening to some tunes. Played a little Warcraft III.

I'm cleaning up my laptop as well. Getting all my personal stuff off of it.
The Micromuse consumption of RiverSoft continues, and anything can happen. Out
of 101 employees in London, 53 have been notified they will be made redundant.
This is UK-speak for &quot;Reduction In Force&quot;, which is US-speak for firing
people.

The same could happen on the US side as well.

So, while the company laptop is not supposed to have &quot;personal&quot; stuff
on it, it does. Though nothing that would get me fired. No p0rn. All the software
that should be paid for, has been. I've cleaned up all the browser cache files,
copied all the licenses for my stuff, deleted the mp3 directory, and cleaned
up all the stuff from the download directory. The next step is to copy the entire
thing to The Beast.
