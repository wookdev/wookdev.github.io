Cell phone didn't wake me up this morning.  Go figure.  I'm not even sure it went off when it was supposed to, even though it seems to be set correctly.

Going to Pittsburg Wednesday and Thursday this week.  This is good, so I won't be in this place without Internet access.  I'm not sure I'm going to make it until next Monday when the cable and phone get hooked up.  I haven't set up the computer yet, because I just can't imagine what I'd do with it.  Watched more of the stuff on the Tivo.

The stove doesn't light.  I'm going to need to put shelves in on the wall opposite the stove too, for the space.  I brought the free-standing, metal, counter up with me, since what Boris (the super) put in had zero usable counter space.

Still can't find the damn alarm clock.  Also can't find the map I had drawn.
