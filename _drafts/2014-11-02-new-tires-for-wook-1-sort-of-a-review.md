A couple of week ago I bought new tires for Wook 1, to replace the Cooper Zeons
it had. I got Michelin PilotSport A/S 3s. It is coming up on winter,
and there will be at least one trip up North during a period of time where there
could be snow on the ground. So, all season tires. I drove around Des
Moines for years in cars with half-bald normal tires with no problems. Full-on
winter tires just don't seem required.

That's not because Wook 1 is 4WD,
because that's not the reason. 4WD helps you go, but tires make you stop.
It is just that I've never driven a car that had snow tires on it, even when
I lived where it would have made sense to do so. If you are careful,
which I am, it isn't a big deal.

When you go on [Tirerack.com][],
there is no ["normal tire" in the 255/35ZR19 size Wook 1 likes][].
You either get some kind of summer performance, winter performance, ultimate
performance all-season, or [even more aggressive type descriptions][].
So I went with the "Ultra High Performance All-Season" category, and got the
PS A/S set.

Summer max performance tires, like the PS3s or P Zeros, are Right Out. At
least right now before winter. I know this from when I first bought the car,
and it has Pirelli P Zero Rosso max performance summer tires. I was in Des
Moines, it snowed, and I did a full-speed power slide thru a busy intersection.
Sideways. Next morning I took it out to McDonalds and it was like trying to
drive and stop a toboggan on a steep hill. Next day, it had the Cooper A/S
tires on it, and it was very sure footed.

But I hated the Zeon's. They were loud. They had a weird road noise
that inside the car often sounded like metallic grinding. This had me really
worried until I figured out what was going on. When they sat for a day or two,
they would get a flat spot and would be bumpy on smooth roads for the first 10
miles or so. That was added to the fact that their ride was just rougher
than the Pirelli's to start with. In their favor, the Zeon's did have really
nice traction on ice and snow. That, they did do well.

I had to replace
them tho. I hit a granite curb in a parking lot, and not only dinged up
the rim, but took a chunk out of the sidewall of the tire too. That damaged
tire was on borrowed time from then on. I am astounded that it lasted
another 800 miles until I could replace it. But that was reason enough
to replace that one, and I replaced all 4 all the way around.

So far,
the Michelin PS A/S tires are nice. They are quieter, in my experience,
tho not as quiet as the Pirelli's were. They ride nicer on all surfaces.
The only real complaint so far is that they seem to be overly squirrelly on
grooved highway surfaces. Even the lightest grooves seem to bring this
out in them. Ally noticed it from the passenger seat. I'm hoping
that a thousand miles or two will even them out a little. The original Pirelli
tires [tramlined][]
really badly for the first 2000 or so miles, but then settled down. Hopefully
the Michelins will settle down after a while too.

I'll want to get max performance summer tires back on the car at some point.
That's really when it is a complete pleasure to drive. My plan has always
been to buy a second set of rims with the "other" tires on them, so I can jack the
car up in the driveway and change them out for the season change. But that
hasn't happened yet. Maybe someday soon.
