Got back from London last night.

It was one of those flights were I was ready to land about 3 hours before we
did. Finished my book. Fortunately, there was a woman in the seat next to me
who was in a chatty mood. 

There was a touch of drama too. A passenger in business class was sick, and
they were going to have paramedics take her off. So we passengers were to leave
the plane from the left isle of the plane, so that the paramedics could get
to her down the right isle. The announcement before we landed said they'd do
this while we were leaving the plane, but they didn't. The paramedics were still
waiting outside the plane when I went back to get my duty free stuff.

Yeah, I bought some scotch in duty free. Then left it on the plane. I don't
get duty free, so of course it didn't occur to me to think about it. Tucked
behind my laptop bag. Out of sight, out of mind. I was almost to immigration
when I remembered. They wouldn't let me back on the plane (understandably) to
get it, but they got it for me in less than two minutes, which was very cool.

This morning, had a massage. Olivia has a natural talent for massage. I floated
through the rest of the day, pretty much. Had to go to the upper West side for
this, but it was worth it. Stopped by Lenny's Bagels and got some real bagels
and lox. Yummy.
