My friends Susan would like it to be known that:
<blockquote>All those emails with the subject "comment link"... and you'd think {ahem} someone would've taken a second to link "<a href="http://www.gack.com/muwahahaha/out_of_the_closet.htm" title="Himself">-- One of the clowns in the closet</a>" or "<a href="http://www.gack.com/muwahahaha/out_of_the_closet.htm" title="Himself">Himself</a>" to that loverly picture of same that appears in the URL provided for <a href="/2004/10/10/2004-10-10-324">that comment</a> -- and thus warn the-ones-who-know-not-what-lays-in-wait-in-their-closets... but no, you'd rather throw linguistic darts at your brave friend who put her life on the line to get that picture and deliver that message...</blockquote>

Now, I'm prefectly willing to do what she asks.  But the blog isn't configured to allow links in comments.  So I haven't because I can't, not because I won't.

This is a public-service annoncement: Now know what you are up against.

EEEK! No wonder she is afraid of it! Clowns *are* Nasty, scary freaks!<br />
Wasn't John Wayne Gacy a clown? And look how he turned out!!!!<br />
Susan needs to buy Clown Repellant. Hmmmm, perhaps I'll get some myself!<br />
The small child in me has been terrorized! Now that I have viewed the link I will <br />
be frightened for some extended time period to be determined later. <br />
I wondered what that noise in the closet was, and now I know.

Ray, you are aptly named (thinking beam of light, as opposed to venomous spine)... and yes, Gacy was indeed "the killer clown," although that is redundant. 

So, where does one find this "clown repellant," and why didn't you share this recommendation before the presidential election?
