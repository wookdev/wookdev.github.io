Here's one you might have to think about if, like me, you come from a culture that hasn't really embraced the idea of using a bidet.

This is a common sight in toilets in India not meant for Westerners:

Yes, that is a sprayer.  No, it is not for hosing down the toilet seat before you sit down.  Or, at least it isn't completely for that purpose.  And yes, there is also toilet tissue in there as well.

Admittedly, we're not talking about pit toilets (a hole in the ground only), which are worse if you aren't practiced on using them.  But still, this took me off guard.  Indians are fastidious, by culture.  And they view wiping your ass with paper, of any so-called "softness", as creepy and silly as I found this.  It is all about cultural orientation and what you're used to.  My friend Dominic has a bidet in his newly renovated house, and he's told me "But Steve, a bidet gets you squeaky clean".  It does have the advantage that other than patting things dry, you don't actually have to touch that end of yourself before it gets cleaned.

### Comments

<blockquote>
I have to say that I think bidets are one of the most civilized inventions ever.  If we ever build, we're going to have one.  And maybe a Sitz bath as well- a complete boon after childbirth or if one has hemorrhoids.  I'm never going to have another kid, but you never know about the second....<br />
