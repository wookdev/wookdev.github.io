Mom, my brother, and my niece were in town this weekend.  They came to see me, and to see my hometown.  In the process, we saw <a href="http://www.siteforrent.com/intro.html" title="Rent">Rent</a>.  I took them to Da Tamaso, one of my most favorite places to eat.  And also the Metropolitan Mesuem of Art.

Once upon a time, I walked all over all the time.  Once upon that same time, I'd have been able to do more.  But now, I don't do that so much any more, and I'm really tired.  My feet are killing me.  It was all worth it though, to see Mom, Kevin, and Nikki.  It was fun.
