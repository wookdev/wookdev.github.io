Running for the airport, but just wanted to get this up before I forget about
it.

My niece, Nikki, had her first hot date this last weekend, I hear. She will
soon be 17. I asked my brother if he had the requisite room full of guns or
martial arts trophies ready to impress the lucky boy. I thought his response
was good:
<blockquote>
I gave her two pieces of advice.
<ol>
<li> For first dates, a movie and coffee is a big commitment. There needs
to be a plan for a quick out, which as it turns out, she used after the
movie.</li>
<li> Tell him I own a gun.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

Something to think about.

And finally, this new pages FINALLY gets pushed to the server so it can actually
be seen by the birthday boy. I'm pushing the button right...
