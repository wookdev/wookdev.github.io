### Comments

Hello, Mr. Houle! I was the costumed steampunk inventor from pictures 72-76 on this year's DemiCon 14 masquerade photos. Thanks again for taking the extra time to set up and manage the photography for us!

I have a request for you as an artist/photographer, though. I've bought (and already received via the postal service) some prints of my costume's photos. However, is it legal/ethical for me to scan and put several of the photos on my long-term costume website, or is there a traditionally more appropriate way to do it? (The URL is above in case you want to see what kind of site your photos would be displayed upon.) Yes, I try to give credit when it's due, but I wanted to check with you first juuuuust in case there's some obscure law that prevents either of us from posting Shufferfly-related photos on a non-commercial website like mine. Plus, if I'm going to show off professional-quality shots of my costume on my site, it seems hypocritical if I post them and then hope that the guy who took the photos in the first place never finds out.

i.e. <br />
In your opinion as the original photographer, do you think I should/could go ahead with posting the photos of my costume onto my site?

Thanks again,<br />
