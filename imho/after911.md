On Tuesday, September 11th, 2001, a day forever known simply
as 9/11, highjackers flew airliners into New York City's World Trade Center.
The "Twin Towers" have existed in the skyline since the late 60s;
far longer than I have lived in this great city. After standing with gaping
holes in their flanks, pouring forth smoke from intense fires caused by 60,000
pounds of jet fuel , the towers finally collapsed upon themselves into a 10-story
pile of twisted metal girders, cement chunks, and shards of glass.

An unknown number of people were killed in the disaster. Many
of them rescue workers responding to the first attack.

A lucky few souls, a very few, were pulled from the rubble by
rescue workers. Everywhere in the City, you can see the desperate hope that
missing people, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, friends, and lovers, will
turn up alive somewhere, somehow. Flyers with names, ages, vital statistics,
and descriptions are posted everywhere. Most notable are the TV vans, some of
which are parked around town, with not a square inch of paint showing between
the missing-persons flyers taped to them. By now, there is a dreadful, but sure,
knowledge that while a couple lucky souls might still be pulled from the wreckage
that is "Ground Zero", the list of the victims is probably written
in the missing persons files.

The show of support has been incredible. So many construction
workers have volunteered to clear rubble that the only way they will take anyone
is if they are an iron/steel worker, and have a union card to prove it. So much
food has been donated to the rescue workers that as much as half of it goes
to waste. Blood centers and hospitals have turned thousands away who wanted
to give blood because they couldn't handle the load. The last I heard, the Red
Cross was looking only for money, and socks.

My part in the whole disaster has been that of a spectator on
the sidelines. I was sleeping late the morning of 9/11; it had all happened
by the time I found out. All I know of the events of 9/11 I learned from TV.
But since then, I have lived and worked with people affected to greater or lesser
degrees. That has affected me. I have seen the confusion and shock of people
who were close enough to the tragedy that they feel they survived it. I have
seen the despair of those who lost loved ones. Talked to people who were across
the street from the WTC when the second plane hit. I have heard their stories
of seeing people falling, maybe jumping, from 100 floors up. I have talked to
people who were supposed to be on one of those airliners, but for whatever reason
were not. I've watched people I know and love barely control emotions, both
the joy of being alive, and the sorrow of loss. I can not help but to empathize,
and try to understand, no matter how inadequately.

We cannot begin to gage the effect this will have on the lives
of Americans from this day forward. Civil liberties that we have always taken
for granted will probably be taken from us in the name of safety. This is probably
the greater tragedy, since the terrorist will have won a victory, however small.
War has been declared on an enemy that exists only as a word in a dictionary.
Normal people will walk around with a haunted look in their eyes anytime they
look down the avenues of Manhattan and see only clear, blue, sky.

Our search for the terrorists who perpetrated this act will cross
all national boundaries. By committing an act so despicable, so huge in scope,
America has been given permission to track down terrorism in all its forms no
matter where it lives. No nation on earth dare tell us "No" when we
show up at the border in force. All nations will submit to an invasion of sorts,
or find themselves actually invaded. The US is often called "cops of the
world" in a derogatory tone of voice by the rest of the world. The world
has seen nothing yet.

My greatest hope is that we treat the nations we invade in the
search for those who did this as well as we would hope to be treated were we
in their place. I hope we leave these places better, cleaner, healthier, than
when we arrived. To do anything else will invite even more hatred.

And maybe that would be the best revenge. Provide food and shelter
to the starving refugees of Afghanistan. To provide medical assistance to any
nation that suffers terrorist attacks no matter how small. Provide technical
and financial assistance to build up the war-torn lands of today to self-sufficiency,
as we did for Germany, France, Japan, and others after World War II.

Only then should we hunt down and punish the terrorists of the
world. Let them see that our soul and spirit - indeed our desire and ability
to do good in the world - can not be crushed. Only then, should we hunt them
down and punish them.
