Wook's First Computer Theory goes: "Stability is good, so 
leave one of them alone".
  
The theory applies if you own more than one computer, and you 
like to "play" with them. If you "mess around" with your 
machines a lot, you should have at least one computer that is "safe", 
and that is your "production" or "stable" machine.

I have two computers sitting on this desk. A 4-year old wintel
box, a Micron Millennia XKu, and an iMac DV. The plan, or theory, behind these 
two machines runs as follows: The wintel box is for games, and fun. The iMac 
is for the serious stuff.

The wintel box is is for games. Windows has more in the way of 
games, and the few I actually enjoy playing generally aren't written for the 
Mac. Some are, a rare few. Civilization tends to be ported early. But others 
I played a lot, Starcraft, Warcraft, are ported to the Mac after I'm done playing 
them. So I have my Micron, with its 21" monitor, loaded with Windows 98, 
and a couple of games. I also have those games running on my work Laptop, which 
is reason number two that I stick to wintel games.

Back when the Micron was the only machine I owned, I would use 
it for everything, games, e-mail, goofing off with interesting software from 
the net. I was also buying interesting hardware to plug into it. And worse, 
I was constantly blowing Windows away to do thing like load OS/2, Be, or Linux. 
I lost bookmarks I'd forget to back up, e-mail folders, assorted documents, 
etc. I tried moving all these things to Zip drives, but after suffering through 
the "Click of Death" twice, I've given up on them.

Loosing the occasional bit of info was inconvenient, but none 
of it was earthshakingly important. I don't really have information I feel I 
need to back up, or that will hurt me if I loose. Plus, the stuff I really didn't 
want to loose (TurboTax files for instance) were in my docs directory which 
I almost always remembered to save.

Backups, with real backup software onto some secondary medium, 
are important when you have a lot of stuff you want to restore. But I'm just 
talking bookmarks, addressbook, e-mail folders, PGP keys, tax records, and assorted 
humor files. All told, about 15 megabytes of data. Not worth backing up a whole 
machine just for that.

But, after rebuilding my addressbook for the bazillionth time, 
I figured there had to be a better way. Nothing on the Micron was stable, and 
I was getting tired of that.

Then Apple Computer came out with the iMac. I thought they were 
pathetically stupid. Not for me. Underpowered, not expandable, small screen, 
smaller hard drive, inferior technologies... my list of reasons to hate the 
thing went on and on.

Of course, about half of the reasons I had to hate the iMac were 
also the same things that made them perfect for the masses. There was nothing 
to go wrong, and they were cheap. The damn things sold like hotcakes. You couldn't 
buy them in stores, you had to go line up out back by the truck and bribe the 
driver to give you one.

Then, there were colors. This was a cool idea, IMHO, because 
it turned a computer into an appliance. Something to fit into the d&eacute;cor 
of the home. Almost every consumer electronics item can be purchased in at least 
black or silver, for example. But of course, Apple being the bunch of 60's throwbacks 
they seem to want to be now days, the colors they picked left me saying "Oh 
please!". No way would I be caught dead with a "Strawberry" iMac. 
And for the most part, I still had all my other complaints about them as well.

They were still popular, and had been around a couple of years. 
Then suddenly, they were different colors (or at least fewer of the stupid ones), 
and they had DVD drives. The basic hardware had also been upgraded a little 
as well. This happened to be about the time I was getting really tired of suffering 
through not always having a stable machine to use for e-mail the web. I also 
kind of wanted to get back into the Macintosh world. I'd had one in college, 
and enjoyed working on it.

So one day, I went to CompUSA and picked out a red, slot loading, 
iMac DV. (The box says: "Strawberry", in case you were wondering. 
Apple can take their colors and shove them.) The theory goes (this is about 
computer theory number one, after all) that this is a machine that I would not 
be tempted to play with. There were no expansion options, no slots, and only 
1 OS that would work on it. I figured the software that came with it would probably 
be sufficient for my modest needs. It came with Netscape, Quicken, and AppleWorks. 
I bought a printer as well, because I didn't want to have to take stuff to work 
to print any more. I also had to spring for the USB converter kit for my Palm 
Pilot, because the iMac doesn't come with serial ports of any type.

And life was good. Quickly I realized that I was going to have 
to have MS Office cause Appleworks just wasn't cutting it for my needs, so I 
bought it. I also bought Civilization II and installed it, so I had something 
to do when I was healing in EverQuest ("EQ"), which I played on the 
Micron. I could also surf the web on the Mac, to look for information about 
EQ, without having to actually quit out of EQ to do it. I installed a couple 
Linux distributions on the Micron, Sun Solaris for x86 machines, OS/2 for a 
while, and finally zapped it to put Win98 back on to play Asheron's Call ("AC"). 
I added 3 more 9 Gig hard drives to it one afternoon, because I had them kicking 
around. Then took them out one by one over the next month as each one died. 
Put Linux back on it (Debian this time) which I took off a week later to install 
Red Alert 2 along side of AC.

All the while, the iMac was here, running. Being stable. Being 
relatively untouched. Those parts of my life that happened on-line were undisturbed 
and uninterrupted.

Heaven.

When I joined RiverSoft in early 1999, there was the threat of 
frequent travel. It didn't happen immediately, though. In Feb. of 2000 however, 
I flew to San Francisco to take over a project there, and almost haven't been 
home since. I was on the road 85% of the time in 2000, and 80% of the time in 
2001. So my home computer use was mostly to pick up my e-mail, with the occasional 
Amazon order thrown in so I'd have something to watch/read/listen to on the 
next airplane. My computing life was tied to assorted Sun Microsystems machines 
scattered around the world, and my trusty Dell laptop. I didn't use the home 
systems much at all. And when I did use one, it was the iMac, because I was 
doing mail of web stuff.

So imagine my surprise then, when one afternoon, when it looked 
like I was going to be in New York for a whole week, maybe two, I purchased 
Dreamweaver, Filemaker, and Photoshop for the iMac

I had a plan. I was going to use my Mac for something real. Catalog 
the huge pile of DVDs that I'd purchased. Actually do something with my web 
site(s). Prototype a history catalog database thingy I had an idea about. Organize 
my digital photos. While I haven't started on all that yet, I have been using 
my Mac more.

So much more, in fact, that I started up the Micron a few weeks 
ago for the first time maybe since late 2000. It immediately went into a recovery 
for what looks like a minor hard drive crash. (Bad blocks all in a couple of 
clusters up front on the drive in the middle of the first FAT table. It remapped 
them, and things continue to work.) But that doesn't bother me, because that's 
the machine I have fun on...

...except it really isn't any more. I haven't turned it on, because 
I'm enjoying working with the iMac more than I do playing Asheron's Call, or 
just messing around with Linux or something. I don't use the Micron much any 
more to goof with Linux. For that I use <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare</a> 
on my work laptop. Or I just do whatever I need to on my laptop, which I use 
Linux on most of the time anyway.

When I got the iMac, my friend Dave laughed and said he could 
see me attaching 120 USB devices to the thing, just to see if I could. He didn't 
get the scope right, but I have also purchased more hardware and plugged it 
into this thing. I have the Palm (USB), an HP scanner (USB), a CD-RW drive (firewire), 
a Maxtor 80 Gig hard drive (firewire), my Nikon digital camera (USB), and lately 
an iPod (firewire).

The little iMac I purchased to be the computer I wouldn't be 
tempted to play with has turned into the primary machine. In some respects the 
only machine. It now takes up more desk space than the mini-tower Micron with 
the 21 inch monitor. It has 10 times more disk space available for use. It 
is actually a faster machine. All this despite the 15" screen, which is 
Very Small. When I got my laptop with a 15" screen, I thought I was going 
to go nuts. It is amazing the things that become normal when you have few other 
choices.

So you might be wondering why all this. Well, this article started 
as a "why I upgraded to Mac OS X on my iMac, and what I think of it". 
However, upgrading my iMac to Mac OS X before it is a totally known quantity 
is against the First Theory. So this has turned into the giant justification 
that it now is, and the OS X thing will happen in another page.
