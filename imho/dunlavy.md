I've always wanted a pair of Dunlavy speakers for my stereo.

Actually, I've wanted them since I was in high school, when the
company name was Duntech, and the speakers were called "Odyssey 2001".
Built by a man by the name of Dunlavy, who is an expert at designing microwave
antennas. He used his expertise in that to design the perfect stereo speakers.
The Odyssey 2001 speakers had very impressive numbers. They were reported to
have awesome sound and the ability to fill a room with thundering bass and delicately
transparent highs.

Then I lost track of Duntech.

15 years later, I was in [Audio-Video Logic][AVL] in Des Moines (hereafter: AVL)
with my friend Dave M. AVL is a very high-end store. I related how the speakers
I wanted were called Odyssey 2001, and wondered what happened to the company
that made them, the name of which started with Dun&lt;something&gt;.

AVL is a Dunlavy distributor it turns out. So Dave, his wife
Jaime, and I spent an hour or two listening to the incredible Dunlavy Audio
Labs, SC-IVa speakers. I was hooked.

Time passed, other priorities were taken care of of. Dave purchased
a pair of Dunlavy SC-III speakers. [Dave says: "It was more like Jaime
insisted and I went along for the ride (not that I'm complaining)."

Then I received an email from Dave. In it, he told me that Dunlavy
was out of business, and that AVL had some of the last speakers, and was negotiating
to pick up all the remaining stock.

So, I called them, to find out what they had. I put a deposit
down on a demo pair of SC-IVa speakers in dark cherry wood. I would stop into
AVL in January, a few weeks later, when I was in Des Moines to conclude the
transaction.

So anyway, the speakers arrived on Monday. There were in four
boxes. Two were the stands, in boxes the size of three pizza boxes stacked on
top of each other. The other two boxes took up all available space in my living
room. More than six and a half feet tall, and a foot by a foot and a half in
cross-section, 200 pounds each shipping weight. I stood there looking at the
boxes, feeling like one of the apes in "[2001: A Space Odyssey][]",
looking at the monolith.

I called AVL, and got some advise from Denny on putting them
together. The secret is a phone book under the lower end, to hold it up while
attaching the bases. Also, while I was on the phone with Denny, I ordered some
<a href="http://www.nordost.com/products/flatline.html">Super Flatline MkII</a>
speaker connects, because I realized the stuff I've been using is in very bad
shape. Robert came over that afternoon, and helped me put them together and
plug them in. We also had to move some things around a little, since these things
kind of changed the landscape at the "media" end of my living room.

Even with the crappy speaker cable, these speakers sound Really
Good. I mean, REALLY GOOD. Amazing. So good, that Rob and I had a problem finding
a CD in my collection that would truly do them justice. So much of pop music
is recorded and mastered incredibly badly, even in this day and age of digital
reproduction. We finally settled on old standards: Mannheim Steamroller's Fresh
Aire IV, and 8, and the Holly Cole Trio's "Don't Smoke In Bed".

"Fresh Aire IV" turned out to be disappointing. It
was recorded 20 years ago or so, and at the time it was very well done. Chip
Davis originally put his Fresh Air albums on LPs that were such high quality
that you could tell them apart by how much heavier they were than a "normal"
vinyl LP. On most of my previous stereos, the pipe organ on the beginning of
this disk was the starting point for evaluating bass response.

Now, "Fresh Aire IV" suffered, badly. There was little
in the actual low end, though you could tell it was supposed to be there. The
pipe organ was not what I was hoping it would be.

So we moved on to "Fresh Air 8". This is fairly recent,
and very well recorded and mastered onto CD. It is a good test because it is
orchestral, choral, and includes electronic instruments in with the ones nature
came up with. It is a complex work, with lots of chances for the speakers to
show their capabilities. It is probably the second best sounding thing I've
got. It sounded fantastic. It had bass. It had treble. It had space. It had
sound-stage. At no time did any part of the recording "get lost" in
any other part. I've listened to this one about 8 time since that first evaluation
with Rob.

The Holly Cole Trio is a stand-up bass, a piano, and Holly Cole's
incredible voice. The first track of "Don't Smoke In Bed" is "I
Can See Clearly Now". It starts with just the stand-up bass. On these speakers,
that bass is real. You can hear it resonate. You can hear the musician's fingers
on the strings, and tell the difference in sounds when he is going fast, or
has time to pluck the strings carefully. You can hear his hand slide along the
frets as it changes position for a different note. You can also walk around
the room while that bass is playing, and hear very plainly where the room itself
has problems. More on that later.

Dire Straits's, self-titled CD was simply disappointing, sound-wise.
Rob commented that he'd always thought of their stuff as having been well recorded.
And once upon a time, it probably was.

Since that first day, I've put a few other things in. Dave Matthews
Band, "Crash" is well done. The guitar on "So Much To Say"
is well recorded, and just enjoyable in general. And "Proudest Monkey"
in addition to being a general favorite, just causes me to sit down and drift
while I listen.

While playing U2's "Achtung Baby" I found a bass nodal
point in my kitchen. This one has a lot of bass, presumably so even people without
rhythm can dance to it. The spot is when standing right between the sink and
stove. In that spot, the bass of this CD was flexing my stomach for me.

I'm saying a lot about bass response in this missive. My previous
speakers, Energy 2.1e speakers, handled the high end pretty well. It is easy
for small speakers to do good highs, simply because the best drivers for the
high end are small, so they can be very fast for high-end reproduction. We all
know what a tweeter looks like, right? The SC-IVa are doing just as incredible
on the full musical range as they are in the bass.

In fact, after listening to them for a week, I started to think
that the bass was over-done. On friday, the speaker cables arrived from AVL
via UPS. Yesterday, I changed from the NAD 216 to the Marantz MA-700 monoblocks,
and put in the Nordost cables. Now the bass is controlled well, and not overpowering,
even on the U2 stuff, and Fresh Air 8. Holly Cole, oddly enough, sounds pretty
much the same, though the bass suffers less from ugly resonances in some places.
I think I'll keep this setup, though I should probably put the NAD back in with
the new cables just to see what their contribution actually is.

The biggest change to my life is that I enjoy listening to music
in my apartment now. This is new. My living room is highly reflective to sound,
because there is very little dampening material. The bare walls and floor cause
the highs to be somewhat shrill, and lows weren't reinforced at all by the room.
The Energy 2.1e setup was never able to overcome this. Music always sounded
overly bright and devoid of anything resembling "bottom". So I would
put in music and then wander away from it.

During my copious free time (ha!), I've been stuck in my love
seat in front of the Dunlavy's since Monday, and have missed TV shows I like
to watch, because I've got some music in that I want to enjoy. (TiVo will record
that TV I want to watch, anyway.) The only reason I've been able to go to work
is that if I play music all night long or to early in the morning, I will be
evicted. I have enough willpower to avoid that.

Still, you never know. The first time I played something, both
Robert and I thought I'd set the volume at a nice, normal, level. Then we found
we had to yell to be heard when we tried to talk. In lesser speakers, one of
the signs of loud is distortion. When the music is fuzzy, it must be loud. But
the SC-IVa's do not get distorted at volume. At least, at no volume I've been
willing to push so far. I've got a mental mark on the volume control, above
which I will not venture, in an attempt to remain a resident of this apartment.

I haven't really done much with DVDs yet. Because I only have
a two-channel setup, I really can't take advantage of 5.1 Dolby Digital (AC-3)
or DTS 5.1 or 6.1. I'm going to have to fix this little problem, since I do
now have enough speakers to make a 4-chanel system. I also ordered some <a href="http://www.superbitdvd.com/">Superbit
DVDs</a>, which should be pretty cool. I keep looking at the AVL website, thinking
that two more pairs of SC-IIa speakers are affordable. I probably know where
to get 4 more MA-700 amplifiers cheap too.

But that is all for the future. Right now, here's to music.
