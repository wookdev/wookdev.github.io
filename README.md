# Munged.Org Source for GitHub Pages Site

Currently the site is hosted at Squarespace, but I'm not entirely happy with it.
Hosting my site on GitHub has some interesting implications that I find interesting
to think about, about portability and accessibility.

I'm new to version control, and am almost an actual programmer.  I once knew a couple
of dead languages (COBOL, Pascal, Fortan, Basic) from back when VAX/VMS was still
a thing.

So be nice here.  I'm doing this to learn.  All help accepted, but I'll be happy if
this repo and associated site are only ever seen by me.

Credit to [Joanna Rutkowska](http://blog.invisiblethings.org/) for this.
GitHub's Pages have been around for longer than she's been using them, but reading
her blog is how this concept entered my consciousness.
