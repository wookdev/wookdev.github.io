# Munged.Org Source for GitHub Pages Site

http://www.munged.org was hosted at Squarespace, but I wasn't entirely happy with it.
Hosting my site on GitHub has some implications that I find interesting
to think about, about portability and accessibility.

I'm new to version control.  I was once almost an actual programmer.  I knew a couple
of now-dead languages (COBOL, Pascal, Fortan, etc) from back when DEC's VAX and VMS
were still things. Mostly what I know of them any more is that I can no longer can be
functional in any of them without a lot of lead time.

I'm doing this project in GitHub partly to learn.  All help accepted, but I'll be happy if
this repo and associated site are only ever seen by me.

Credit to [Joanna Rutkowska](http://blog.invisiblethings.org/) for this.
GitHub's Pages have been around for longer than she's been using them, but reading
her blog is how this concept entered my consciousness.
