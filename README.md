# Munged.Org Source for GitHub Pages Site

Currently the site is hosted at Squarespace, but I'm not entirely happy with it.
Hosting my site on GitHub has some implications that I find interesting
to think about, about portability and accessibility.

I'm new to version control, and am almost an actual programmer.  I once knew a couple
of dead languages (COBOL, Pascal, Fortan, Basic) from back when VAX/VMS was still
a thing.  The university I went to started teaching C the year after I left.
Mostly what I know of them any more is that I no longer can be functional
in any of them without a fair amount of lead time.

I'm doing this project in GitHub partly to learn.  All help accepted, but I'll be happy if
this repo and associated site are only ever seen by me.

Credit to [Joanna Rutkowska](http://blog.invisiblethings.org/) for this.
GitHub's Pages have been around for longer than she's been using them, but reading
her blog is how this concept entered my consciousness.
