There are some things that I find interesting, and might post on repeatedly.  This
page is intended to track those in one place.

### Autonomous Vehicles:

I'm interested in the progress of autonomous vehicles, like automobiles and trucks,
and the changes that they represent in how our society functions in a larger sense.

### Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAV, or "drones")

I own and fly a UAV.  I'm very interested in the laws and rules about using them.
The FAA punted on making rules/laws about how they can be used, so far.  Despite
that, the FAA has allowed some corporations to use them for commercial purposes on
one-off, undefined license, system.
