The new cell phone is, well... a cell phone. What else is there to say? Despite
the fact that Sean has the same phone I have (or rather, I have the same one
he does) he doesn't have the clock screen saver on his. Very interesting. Can
you say "slipstreaming", boys and girls? Sure, I knew you could.

Jim Keck called me today and asked me if I knew the root password for the server
named "Stan". I used to work at Salaam Smith Barney with Jim. I left
SSB three years ago, give or take two weeks, to join RiverSoft. I meet up with
Jim every now and then, though it has been a while now. At the time, we were
on a South Park kick, and so the server got named Stan. It sat under my desk
for a while. Not that I remembered any of that without calling him up to ask
him which server Stan was. I mean, it has been THREE YEARS, for crying out loud...

I'm calm.

Anyway, having lunch with him this week.

Helen and Stu (and Bob) coming in this week for St. Paddy's Day. Looking forward
to the weekend.

The iMac is back to being a Mac OS 9 machine for a while, while I do some scanning.
(HP is being butt-heads about driver support for their scanners under OS X.)
Also burning some CD's, and I have a working Toast for OS 9, but not OS X.

You can see the lights of the 9/11 memorial from my apartment. I think. They
aren't a distinct square of light like on TV, but you can see them way up high.
