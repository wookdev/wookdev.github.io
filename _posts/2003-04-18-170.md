title: "Geeking Out On A Friday Night"

So, it is a Friday night, and I'm at home.  I should be out having fun, but I'm not.  Rather, I'm getting ready for my DSM trip in a couple of weeks.  The biggest thing was to get the ThinkPad ready to be the repository of all photos.

That involved putting Nikon View 6.0.1 on it...

THAT involved somehow hacking my way into XP, because it would seem I forgot my password somehow.  That I would forget a password on this machine isn't actually possible, but I couldn't log into XP, so it must be true, or the password I know I needed had expired.  I finally gave up on that, and just blew it away and re-installed XP...

THAT involved getting the IBM Restore function to work, because putting Linux and Grub on the box messed that all up.  I finally got it to work...

THAT involved using the restore partition to create a floppy (!) to "fix" the restore partition so XP could be reloaded with extreme prejudice...

THAT involved getting rid of the non-dos partitions on the machine, which it seems the restore can't do...

THAT involved finding a Linux CD to boot from, get into rescue mode, and fdisk the partitions away, since DOS fdisk didn't seem up to the task.

(And people ask me what it is about computers and technology that is driving me out of the industry.)

Oh, and yeah, I said "floppy disk".  I haven't used a floppy for anything serious in so long, I'm pretty sure if I actually used any of the ones I have here, the megnetic stuff would just flake off in the computer.  I should probably buy a box of them, just to have around.  I seem to have a need for a few every year.

So I...

Blew away the linux partitions...

Created the restore recovery floppy...

Fixed the restore partition...

And re-installed XP.

The re-install of XP is STILL GOING.  I started the actual process of installing software (copying files) at 7:00 pm or so.  For the first hour, various dos-based install programs copied stuff around, rebooting every couple of minutes.  It spent the next hour after that, installing XP.  Then it spent a half hour installing assorted IBM programs, a few of which are actually useful.  I've spent the last 90 minutes running Windows Update.  I hope to have this machine ready for Nikon View -- remember Nikon View, that is the reason for all this -- by the time I head off for Des Moines in a couple of weeks.

Not a glamorous Friday night, but a useful one.

P.S. Yes, I used the word "floppy" twice.
