Got up at 4:30 AM to catch a 5:00 AM car to Newark and fly to London Heathrow.

You do the math on how much sleep I got.

I flew Virgin Atlantic for the first time. An interesting airline. Bent on
being good to customers, they have lounges on the airplanes, and the seats are
pretty comfortable, unlike most airlines. The seats are not what Boeing or Airbus
ships with your average airframe. In fact, much of the fittings of the cabin
are not manufacturer standard. You can tell what manufacturer standard is because
Every Other Plane on Every Other Airline all look exactly alike, except for
colors and patterns on the upholstery. Virgin's planes are appointed differently.

However, if you are over 6 feet in height, you will not fit in coach class.
Virgin has much less space than even American Airlines used to. If you fly these
guys, go Premium Economy, which actually can cost the same as coach on any other
airline.

The entertainment system was pretty cool. 44 Movies on demand, and you can
pause them when you have to visit the loo.

This is all on Virgin's A340-600 airliners.

Sunday is training. Monday is training. Tuesday is training, then fly back
home that night, to be in NYC for 9/11.
