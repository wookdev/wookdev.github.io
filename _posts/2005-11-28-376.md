For lunch, the earliest I could get moving, I met up with the two Daves at the <a href="http://www.espnzone.com/lasvegas/">ESPN Zone</a> in <a href="http://www.nynyhotelcasino.com/">New York, New York</a>, a quick walk across the street from the <a href="http://www.montecarlo.com/">Monte Carlo</a>.  DaveO ordered me a huge burger, which arrived shortly after I did.  It was pretty good, but I was full all the rest of the day.

From there, I went back to my room, then got the vehicle out of valet and went searching for a <a href="http://www.spring.com">Sprint</a> store to get a charger for my phone.  I'd left my charger in the hotel in Milwaukee, and my phone was slowly running out of juice.  I did last until Sunday night from being fully charged Friday morning though.  I was impressed, the extendo-life battery was worth the price, for this, since I was using it a lot to meet up with the rest of the crowd.

<a href="http://www.zumanity.com/">Zumanity</a> was a late show, so we did dinner early. We met at <a href="http://www.harrahs.com/our_casinos/rlv/dining/dining_detail_012.html">the Wine Cellar</a> in the <a href="http://www.harrahs.com/our_casinos/rlv/index.html">Rio</a> hotel.  Marc and Leslie gave me some gifts, a book on scotch, and a bottle of scotch.  A 41 year old bottle of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=glenburgie" title="Google search">Glenburgie</a>.  Yum.  And we sat around for a while chatting and having a good time hanging out for a bit before dinner.  Dinner was in the <a href="http://www.harrahs.com/our_casinos/rlv/index.html">Rio</a> also, at an indian place called <a href="http://www.harrahs.com/our_casinos/rlv/dining/dining_detail_06.html">Gaylord</a>.  It was good, I had chicken vindaloo, which is what I mostly get at indian places.

<a href="http://www.zumanity.com/">Zumanity</a> itself was good, though not up to the amazing standards of other <a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/default.htm">Cirque du Soleil</a> shows.  Maybe I'm just an old perv and not easily shocked or something, but <a href="http://www.zumanity.com/">Zumanity</a> was mostly just a typical show they do, acrobatics mostly, with nudity.  No unifying story, as in some of the other, and nothing overtly sexual.  The nudity in <a href="http://www.mgmgrand.com/pages/entertainment.asp?link=lafemme">Le Femme</a> was of much higher quality, not that I didn't appreciate some of the ladies in <a href="http://www.zumanity.com/">Zumanity</a> too.

Oh well.  It was still fun.
