Spent a few hours today in Central Park, taking pictures.  I haven't had the camera
out to the park in way to long.  It was also just nice to be out and around,
something I haven't been able to do as much as I'd like recently.

I can't wait until I get <a href="http://www.specialized.com/SBCBkModel.jsp?spid=9614"
title="Crossroads XC Pro">my new bicycle</a> so I can ride it in the park or wherever.
Give me something fun to do on a nice weekend day.  The frustrating part is that the
bike I need isn't being released until December for the 2005 model year.

Oh well.
