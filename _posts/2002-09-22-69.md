Just got back from seeing " Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever" tonight. It
is an action movie, with good action. Nothing else needs to be said about, or
for, this movie.

Slept the whole day away today. Woke up at 11:30. First time in two weeks that
I've been able to sleep past 7 AM. Course, I didn't get to bed until almost
6 AM.
