As some know, I'm putting all of my CDs into iTunes on my Mac.  I'm just over half-way done now, with just over 20 Gig of AAC files on my hard drive.  All of my CDs should fit in just under 40 Gig of hard drive space.

So anyway, sooner or later, I have to get to ABBA.

I like ABBA.  Or rather, I liked the good stuff that ABBA did.  The gloriously soft, multi-tracked, female voices.  The toe-tappingly infectious pop tunes.  They were mindless pop at its best.

So I ripped and encoded the 4 ABBA CDs in the box set.  And then, because I don't want them all on the iPod, I played them, rated them, and turned off the ones I didn't like so much.  So far, so good.

But, I've just spent the last 4 hours listening to ABBA. **ALL of ABBA**. I managed to last what I thought was a long time, before signs of psychosis started to appear.  Around about half way through the second CD, I suddenly had this craving to go baby seal hunting.

I'm better now.  I went through the rest of ABBA as fast as I could, turning off anything I'd never heard before.  Now, I'm listening to Marilyn Manson, and life is in balance again.
