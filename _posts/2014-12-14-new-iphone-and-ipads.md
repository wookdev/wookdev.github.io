title: New iPhone and iPad

The plan is to get upgraded to current iPhone, and iPad.  I have a new iPhone 6, 128 Gig on Verizon.  Those phones are hard to find out in the wild, but for assorted reasons I couldn't order it from the Apple Web Store.  I found one in Albuquerque last week.  I did order an engraved iPad Air 2 from the Apple Web Store, and it was waiting for me when I got home yesterday.

I just need to get Ally an iPhone, and then the current upgrade cycle is complete. I should actually be able to get her phone thru the Web Store.

Ally was already on Verizon, and I have switched to it.  I have mixed feelings about this. It is really nice to be able to use my personal phone in my house. AT&T didn't serve this area very well, and I had a lot of dropped calls.  My work mobile phone is on Verizon, because I had this same problem in DUMBO before I moved to the woods of Carrboro.

Verizon has good coverage, and they use CDMA, so the call quality will be good.  But they are just evil incarnate.  I switched from Sprint to Verizon back in the day, so I could get a Motorola Razer flip phone. It would access the internet, and I even tried it once.  There was a "landing page" that indicated if you proceeded, you'd be using the internet and would be charged for it.  What that landing page didn't say was that it itself was on the internet, and you were already being charged for using it.  This sleazy move got Verizon slapped with a lawsuit, which they lost.

So.  The ability to use my phone from home if I so choose.  Or not supporting evil asshole corporations.  Kind of an ugly choice.

After a few years of shitty "service" on AT&T's part, I am done. I am on Verizon. I could have gone with Sprint, but I had an iPad Air 2 that I returned, and had it on Sprint for a while, and didn't have good coverage from home with them either.

I still feel queasy about this choice tho.
