Some times I go to sites where I can register internet domain names, and just plug assorted words in to see if they are registered, and/or available.  My favorite tool for this is <a href="http://www.domainsurfer.com/">DomainSurfer</a>.

But I just stumbled onto <a href="http://www.waxy.org/projects/domains/">a site</a> that comes at this from the other direction.  Using a <a href="http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/">list of common words</a> hosted on <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>, this guy does a lookup on domains in use, and makes a list of the dictionary words on the list that aren't yet domains.

Some of my favorites:
<blockquote> scrota.com (I can't believe this isn't a gay-porn site)<br />
veined.com<br />
abjurer.com<br />
cloacae.com<br />
foul-up.com<br />
leprous.com<br />
no-show.com<br />
octette.com<br />
off-key.com<br />
stabber.com<br />
tacitly.com<br />
abnegate.com<br />
</blockquote>
Even the short list - the one for the dot com left-overs - is pretty large.  there are even a couple of (mostly lame) web site ideas kicking around on this list.
