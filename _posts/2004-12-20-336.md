Thanks for all the emails after I posted about my grandmother's death.  I appreciate them.  Thank you all.

My grandmother has been getting progressively more ill over about the last two years.  When I saw her over Thanksgiving, she was constantly tired.  It was really hard to see her like that, but I'm glad I was there.

She had serveral really nasty problems.  We got word on Tuesay that her doctors had taken her off her medication, and given her something to make her confortable.  She had been in a nursing home for 5 days or so.  She died Wednesday morning just after midnight.  My brother told me that her doctors said her assorted problems weren't yet bad enough to cause her death.  I think she just finally decided it was time.

So she died peacefully with a nurse there with her.

The service was well attended.  Her grandchildren (me and my cousins) were pallbearers.  She was cremated, and will be buried next to her mother, my great grandmother Rachel, in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

I am ferociously proud of the life she lived.  I hope to do half as well for myself.
