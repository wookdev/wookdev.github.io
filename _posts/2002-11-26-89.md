News on the family front, from Dad:

Erin in my oldest sister.

No name or other details yet. More when I know. Rudy, Erin, and baby Espino
are all reported to be doing fine.

As an interesting note, this makes my brother a new uncle. I'm going to have
to teach him the ropes of uncledom. (Unclehood? Uncling?)
