The automatic ice maker in the freezer of the fridge.

This one thing is worth all the trouble.  Worth the broken ankle.  And even, slightly, worth having a commie-pinko fridge.

The ability to just reach into the fridge and pull out and handfull or two of ice for a drink... priceless.

I have always felt that way about ice makers. And in this case, it's really true that once you've had it, you'll never go back. At least not willingly.
