If there is a defining description of my sense of humor it would have to include the words "sarcasm" and "irony".  I really enjoyed both the sarcasm and irony of <a href="http://humane.sourceforge.net/unpublished/saddam_ebay.html" title="Finally, We Do Something Right">"Finally, We Do Something Right"</a>, writen by <a href="http://humane.sourceforge.net/home/" title="JefRaskin.Com">Jef Raskin</a>, inventor of the "click-and-drag interface", and one of the designers of the original Macintosh.
