Heard on the street today.  Man, standing on sidewalk, cell phone to his ear.
<blockquote>
"There is a difference between speculation, and fact." <br />
...listens... <br />
"No, see that's the problem you got.  You are speculating that I'm stupid enough to buy that lame-ass story you are pushing.  The fact of the matter is, I'm not.  You understand me?"
</blockquote>
