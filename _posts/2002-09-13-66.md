My new laptop is damn cool. Though part of it might be (dare I say it?) Windows
XP.

The IBM X-24 has a single PC Card slot (not used), a CF (compact flash) card
slot, an IR (infrared) port, and built-in 802.11b wireless. Then I figured out
that I can sync my Palm with the laptop via the IR port. This doesn't get any
better.

First meeting with real live customers today. Went well. Supposed to get together
with Henry tonight, but he must have gotten diverted.
