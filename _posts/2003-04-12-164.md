I've never seen Rio Bravo before.

I like it.  It's a pretty good movie.

After that, I put in "Support Your Local Sheriff".  A stupid movie, but a really funny, and fun, stupid movie.

I recomend both of these movies.  If you don't have them both, or don't have time for both, you can just watch one or the other.  They are pretty much the same story, one is just funnier than the other.
