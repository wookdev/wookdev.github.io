Emilie, my middle little sister, got married today. She is now
Emilie Ann Hansen. Her new husband, Casey, seems pretty cool. The wedding went
off without a hitch, and the reception was fun.

I ran around the whole weekend taking pictures with the
new camera. I will post some photos when I get the pictures back.
