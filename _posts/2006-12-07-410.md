Thursday I left a wake up call for 9:00AM, since I needed to be on my way to the airport at or before 10 to catch my 11:35 flight out. One of the nice parts about having a real human make your wake up call, is you can ask them to send up breakfast. The operator transferred me to room service. And that is when the day started sliding into the crapper.

Due to a gas-line problem, room service had no gas to cook anything with. They had no hot food, unless you wanted waffles or oatmeal. So I ordered oatmeal and fruit sent up, and then took a shower.

No gas also apparently means no hot water too. I was not in a good mood for my flight home.

At the airport, the flight was delayed a half hour, but then sat on the ground until after 1:00PM. Again, I missed my connection in Chicago, when I finally got there. It was pushing back when I got to the gate. But, flights to New York City from Chicago on AA are frequent, so I got on the next flight, which left at 8:30 PM.

I got home after midnight and collapsed in bed.
