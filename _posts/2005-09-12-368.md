I was asked to be the Fan GoH for <a href="http://www.demicon.org" title="DemiCon">Demicon</a> 18, this weekend.  DemiCon 18 would be in 2007, so there is yet time for <a href="http://www.dmsfs.org" title="Des Moines Science Fiction Society">DMSFS</a> (DemiCon's organizers) to come to their senses.

I'm still very honored that they would think me worthy.  I'd like to thank them for making my year.

That year being 2007, or course.

Well, we could have voted for you for seventeen.  But you know how the story goes, Wook.  Diane says that you would come anyway, and we all like Ted & Darice, and

and congratulations!

This year I even voted for you. I guess it's an idea whose time has come.

By the way, I knew you had been selected as Fan GoH before I made that crack about "You'd never catch DemiCon paying your expenses to come here." I think there was also something about us knowing you're a slut, and we don't have to pay you to come.
