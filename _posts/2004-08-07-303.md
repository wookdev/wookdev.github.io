The joke here is that the sign says "Elite Hackers Rule!!" in "Leet speak".  It probably didn't say that to start with when put there by the DoT of wherever this was.  (Or it is probably a photoshop job, but whatever.)  But it still cracks me up when I loot at this.

"Leet speak" is actually gamer culture speak.  Gamers like to think of themselves as "hackers", even though they aren't.  Still, that is what makes this funny, because the perpetrator of this IS a hacker.
