I am far too talentless to have committed this bit of artistry.  It is something I bought a while ago.

It finally arrived here at Wook Central today, and I unpacked the crate and hung
the picture on the wall above my couch.  It pretty much takes up the ENTIRE
wall, above the couch.

The painting is by Michael John Hill, an artist in the UK.  It is of a foggy
scene, and is painted is such a way that as you lower the light level, the
painting goes through the phases of sunset, or sunrise.  It is uncanny.  It
is also hard to describe, so I'm not going to try.

I got my painting at <a href="http://www.atlasgalleries.com/"
