The new aquarium, which has been sitting around for a couple of months empty
so far, is on its way to functionality. It has been washed out, and now has
water and an air stone in it. The heater is also in it, but I won't plug it
in until tomorrow to make sure it is still water tight. Even though I got a
"working tank", it still needs things to complete the setup. There
is a trip to the store coming soon. Filter media, gravel, plants, and extension
cords for power would round things out nicely.

Tomorrow's task is the get the canister filter running.
