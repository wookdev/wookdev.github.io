title: "All Systems Upgraded: OS X 10.10.3, and iOS 8.3"

Big upgrade today for the Apple devices around Wook Central.
Yosemite 10.10.3 on the Macs.  iOS 8.3 for iPad and iPhone.

This isn't the "Apple Watch" update, that already happened with iOS 8.2.  This was
about security and bug fixes.  On the Mac it was also about the "new" photo management
app that in a fit of imagination
Apple has renamed from "iPhoto", to "Photos".  It now matches, in name and icon, the
photo app on iOS.

"Photos" has been working on upgrading my "iPhoto" library to the new "Photos"
library for about a half hour now, and there's only about 500 photos in it.  If
every Lightroom upgrade took that long, they'd each be a two-day process.

No real changes I can see other than that.  Which is okay with me.
