Most people now days know football better than I do.  My travel schedule (fly out on Sundays...) means I haven't really been able to keep up with the NFL.  Tonight, I had a good conversation with a dude that put my non-fandom of the Minnesota Vikings into perspective, along the "it could be worse" direction.

When the Vikings lost their forth Superbowl attempt, my brother changed to being a LA Rams (the Rams were still in Anaheim then) fan pretty much before the next season started.  It took me a few years to totally loose respect for the Vikes, but the damage was done and it happened eventually.

So tonight, the comment at the bar was: "Well, look at the Buffalo Bills, they went to the Superbowl 4 times, **in a row**, and lost them all too".

Conforting.  Somehow.
