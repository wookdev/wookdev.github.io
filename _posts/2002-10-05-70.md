Saw <a href="http://bventertainment.go.com/movies/spiritedaway/index.html">"Spirited
Away"</a> last night with Rob. A very fine flick. This movie is something
that Hollywood can't seem to do these days. It is a simple story, well told,
without stupid tricks to make it "interesting". The plot manages to
logically progress from one part of the story to the next without telegraphing
its intentions. Even though this film is aimed at young girls, it should appeal
to all.

The other thing I liked about Spirited away, was that buy about half an hour
in, the plot was to complicated to actually describe. But yet, every loose end
got tied up in a satisfactory manner, by the end of the movie. When was the
last time that Hollywood did that?

Oh, and it is Anime. But that isn't why it is good.

Every time I start up Dreamweaver, I end up looking at the picture to the left. This
is because the image library of DW is usually what opens up, and this picture
is the first of many files with a name of "0.jpg". So I thought I'd
share that with you all.

Updated the humor file: <a href="../rofl/overlord.html">Overlord</a> to clean
up errant line-breaks.
