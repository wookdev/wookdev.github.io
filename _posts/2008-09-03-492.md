I found this in my iChat window today, from my friend Meg.  It made me laugh at a time I was in a foul mood and needed a laugh.

Other than the joke here, I'm always "Away" or some variation, all the time.  I don't set iChat to "Available" any more because I'm not good at remembering to set it back away when I leave the computer.  I figure being perpetually away and will sometimes answer is better than being always available but never responding.  So my friends have learned to just poke my cage and see if I stir.
