The Squarespace account expired yesterday.  So I've updated DNS and re-pointed
www.munged.org to this version of the site.  The change should only be noticeable
if you happened to be reading it when it changed.  Or remember what the site looked
like on SS.

The other change is that it was trivial to import all the old blog posts from
previous blogging systems into this.  At least the ones I still have.  Most
posts are dreck, but even the new ones are dreck, so I'm still running about
average.
