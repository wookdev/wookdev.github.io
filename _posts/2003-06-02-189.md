R.A.F. Jameson is dead.

R. A. F. Jameson had seemed healthy to me, alive and well. Though I must admit on reflection, that I hadn't seen him much recently. I'm not sure of the date of his passing, but I just found out this evening.

R.A.F. was a man of dreams. That person we all looked to, knowing that someday perseverance would win out, and his star would shine. We looked forward to being able to tell our friends that we knew him when...

But, now he's gone. And his dreams die along with him. And nothing sucks more than the death of a dream. No pain is as sharp as the intrusion of a life more plain. It is not a transition to a better place. It is not a new journey on a road anyone would rather travel. It is not a fresh start. There is no way to see the full half of the glass, because this glass is empty.

Hopefully, a small spark will live on. That R.A.F., our friend, will live on in our hearts, knowing that he should have become something, certain that he was worthy.

A wake will be held, I think. More details when there are any.
