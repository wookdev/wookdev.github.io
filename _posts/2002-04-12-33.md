Taxes done. Getting money back. In a good mood, finally. Sorta.

Dave asked me today how I get any money back when I don't own anything to deduct.
I don't know, but I've always gotten a return. I guess the plan for the rest
of the year should be to own something to deduct.

Talked to Megan today. Her birthday was yesterday, but I couldn't believe that
I actually managed to record this in my Pilot, so I didn't totally believe it.
Called her today to verify the date, and then wished her a happy birthday.

<b>Happy Birthday Meg!</b>

So, I'm going to spend the rest of the night geeking out, playing Civ or something.

Sallie is going to be in town this weekend. Have to call her and find out how
to hook up with her while she is here.
