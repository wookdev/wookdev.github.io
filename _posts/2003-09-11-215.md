I went to the doctor today.  This is a big deal, since I'm one of those mostly healthy people who go to a doctor only after I'm convinced that death is coming soon.  But I promised some people I'd go see one, so I did.

The prognosis: I'll live.

Hopefully, an ultrasound, a neurologist, and an ophthalmologist will all come to the same conclusion when I go to see them.
