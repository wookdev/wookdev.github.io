My friend Anne proclaimed my a "<a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=vulgarian&x=0&y=0" title="Vulgarian">Vulgarian</a>" the other night.  Apparently this is a term fresh out of "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095159/" title="A Fish Called Wanda">A Fish Called Wanda</a>".  It has been a while, and it is a good movie, so I'm going to have to watch it to check.

She meant it in the best possible way, which is how I took it.

Yay Verily. The Lady Anne - She who is so Wise hast proclaimed publicly what many have known for so very long. And Thou hast in the past thru thine own proclamation given warning to those gentle persons around ye that thou art indeed a vulgar person. And shall speak and behave as such. Yay Verily. So has it been vulgar, so shall it continue to be. All that remains for it to be revealed that Thou art the KING of Vulgaria so that thee may taketh  thine rightful place as Ruler of the greater and lesser Vulgarians of the world. Vulgaria UNITE!!!!
