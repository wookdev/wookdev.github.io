Got my wireless network going here in my apartment. 802.11b, 2.4 GHz, insecure
as hell. So now I can use my laptop wherever I want to. Surf the web while sitting
on the couch watching TiVo. It seems I get "excellent" signal strength
in the entire apartment., which is cool. I was warned that the LinkSys AP wasn't
very good on range. But it would seem it is good enough for me.

I can't live without it.
