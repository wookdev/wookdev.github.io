Marc said he had some response to something on this site, but since he couldn't
just type it in he wasn't going to risk me editing it. I think he's a wimp.
Hell Marc, if it is entertaining, I'll promise to put it up here in its entirety,
unedited. But it must be entertaining!

I think I shall renew my attempts to find decent blogging software, so that
we can have a forum here. Probably be more fun that way.

I was supposed to go to out with my friend Susan tonight. But it has been the
kind of week where I just want to hide for a while. Taxing. So here I sit, rebuilding
my iTunes library, updating the web sites, and generally having a quiet, pleasant
night at home.
