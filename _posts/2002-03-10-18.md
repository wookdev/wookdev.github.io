What is the difference between a <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=journal">journal</a>
and a <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=diary">diary</a>? Looking
these words up is interesting. It would seem that they can be the same thing.
"Diary" and "journal" are even defined in terms of each
other. How circular. So they are the same thing, except that papers and magazines
can be journals. Like medical and scientific journals, or The Wall Street Journal.

I seem to be living this strange half-life in the UK the last few months. So
this shall be a journal, because "diary" in the UK means the same
as "calendar" or "schedule" does in the US. In the UK, the
phrase is "is there time in your diary?"

In the UK, "schedule" is pronounced as "shed-yule", though
they pronounce "school" like the US does. Go figure.

Anyway. The possible move to the UK progresses. I now have a UK work permit,
which allows me to stay in the UK long enough to have to actually pay taxes.
In the process of hunting down information on the move, I ran across a <a href="http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/">UK
Inland Revenue</a> page that <a href="http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/pdfs/ir20.htm">describes
what "residency" means with regard to taxes</a>. Inland Revenue is
the UK version of the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">United States IRS</a>.

I finished the second Harry Potter book last night. I haven't read any of them
before now, because I have a huge aversion to anything that gets over-hyped.
Harry Potter was hugely over-hyped. Both the books and the eventual (inevitable?)
movie. I liked the movie, and after reading the first HP book, the movie did
a reasonable job of translating Mr. Potter to the screen. The first two have
been really good, with an incredibly imagined world. I'm enthralled.

I'm thinking of renaming the new Mac to "beast". Currently, it is
named "lady", because I figured that I would be spending so much time
in front of it that there was no way I'd be able to socialize. No socialization
means no woman. It would be cool to have a woman, but I really don't spend time
in ways that makes finding a relationship easy. Oh well.

Naming the computer "beast" is, in itself, short sighted, in much
the same way that naming it "Lady" is pathetic. In another six months,
it will not be the top of the line monster from Apple. Gonna hafta figure out
some name. "Mac" just isn't fun enough.

Friday night I went down and walked around Ground Zero. More on that latter,
maybe.

FreshMeat is either down or my part of the net has forgotten about it.
