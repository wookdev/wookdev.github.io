A few or you know that I am going to India, as in the country of India, for work.  Well, I've arrived.

Everything went off without a hitch.  The flights were long, but weren't bad.  Being in international business class was good.  The airline food didn't suck.  Frankfurt airport does suck.  The Bangalore airport is new, and has been open for exactly a week now, and is very nice-looking.  Not sure if it's a good airport or not though.  I'm in the hotel, which is also nice-looking.  The internet access is free.

More later, since I just spent about 26 hours getting here with basically no sleep on the planes, and it is now 3AM here.  Sleeping now.
