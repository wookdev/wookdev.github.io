I'm not sure why I'm posting this.  I haven't seen the movie yet, even though its been open for almost a whole 12 hours so far.

Negative reviews abound. Does <a href="http://www.whatisthematrix.com/" title="What Is The Matrix">Matrix Revolutions</a> suck as bad as it is reported to?  Were unrealistic expectations set by the first Matrix movie?  Was the first movie a fluke that was REALLY missunderstood, and we've set outselves up for dissapointment?

I will have to see it to figure it out.

No spoilers if you read more, though some of the links do have spoiler info at the other end of them.  If you don't want to know, don't click on any links.

How bad are the reviews?  A couple of the more thoughtfull reviews:

<a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/" title="The Weekly Standard">The Weekly Standard</a> has a <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/338luveg.asp" title="The Matrix: Exposed (spoilers)">review</a> that tears the movie apart.

The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/" title="BBC News">BBC</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3240071.stm" title="Matrix end is no revelation">wasn't amused</a> either.  This one is especially damning.
