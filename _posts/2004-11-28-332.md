For the last few months, this blog has been getting spammed.  Some automated bot(s) out there have been inserting comments to entries, with links to shady internet pharmacy sites, check cashing sites, and assorted other trash.  You've probably never seen these posts, because for the most part they were all posted on really old entries.  I get emails from the site on every post, so I know when they show up.

Well, no more.  I just installed a blacklist plugin, with the hope that this crap will now be rejected.
