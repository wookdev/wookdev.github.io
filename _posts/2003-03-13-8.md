So, I'm sitting here, logged in just before heading off to work, trying to think of a new post for the journal or something.  I'm doing this because it is actually this easy to add new entries.  Just sit down, bring up the web browser, and type.

Can't come up with anything other than this, which is kind of lame.  But it was easy.
