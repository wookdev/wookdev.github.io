Susan is honked off with my implied suggestion in yesterday's update that she
objected to what I've written about her this week. Just for the record, she
thought it was funny.

No word on whether she is actually pushy and/or cruel.

As for Gerry, she's still indignant that I suggested she didn't notice several
silly mistakes on my part on assorted areas of this web site. She somehow seems
to think that she isn't supposed to proofread this whole site for errors. I
know for a fact that she can just call up <a href="/">the home page</a>, lay
her hands on the monitor, and a list of typos will just magically appear in
my mailbox. I just can't figure out why she won't do this simple miracle for
me.

Some people.

In other news, I think I have to get a new cell phone, if I'm going to continue
to use it for overseas. Most of today, I couldn't get out of the country. Fast
busies, and error codes spoken to me without a british accent seem to be the
norm for today on trans-Atlantic calls.

Looking for a couple of beers tonight with Sean. Should be a good time, if
he makes it back to NYC in time.
