I'm laughing.  I was told this would happen.  I'm not surprised at all, but still
for some reason it is funny that I got the email I just got.  My boss at EMC,
<a href="/2006/10/20/2006-10-20-402">the company I left 8 weeks ago</a>, asked
what happened to my corporate laptop.  And if I still had it, could I send it in.

During my exit interview, the HR lady told me that this would happen.  I didn't
doubt her, I'd never seen any evidence during my tenure that EMC had a good IT
hardware tracking system.  The laptop in question was 4 years old when I gave
it back to them, being the only laptop I'd ever had thru SMARTS to EMC\|SMARTS.

Since HR knew this would happen, the HR lady (wish I could remember her name)
suggested that I have the IT dude, Nick, send her an email saying he'd received
from me, one laptop and all the accessories.  I watched him do it.  You would
think this would be enough for that laptop to be locatable later.  But I guess
not.
