As I was coming back from grabbing a sandwich for lunch today and as I walked past Front Street Pizza (actually a deli that makes the worse pizza sauce it has been my horror to taste) two women wearing MTA uniforms came out.

One said to the other at the top of her voice: "I thought they had meatloaf."

Said the second one: "What are we going to do now?"

I suppose this could be innocent, and nothing very strange.  Maybe you had to be there.  But it kept me chuckling to myself for hours, today.
