I installed the MyFitnessPal app on my phone on Saturday.  I signed up on the
website for it too.  It is a food slash fitness tracker, much like any other.
It integrates with Health on the iPhone.

You put in some current information, and goals.  I put in my height and weight,
and gave it the goal of losing weight, and what my target is.  It then suggests
a calorie count to aim for each day, as well as the types of each nutrient that
you should have, carbs, fat, etc.  You enter what you eat each day, and it has
a huge list of foods defined that you can pick from, and it then uses that
info to track you against your goals.

I am not interested in the suggestions for how to reach my goals.  I have a
plan, and it has been working so far.  I was more interested in finding out
what my calorie counts are, and the other nutrition information.

Just three days in to putting my meals in this thing have already been
surprising.  I had sometimes said it was hard, eating like I'm eating, to
actually have 3000 or 4000 calories of food in a day.  But I wasn't totally sure
that was true.  Now I am.

Friday night, I took Ally out for her birthday, and had a steak dinner, along
with a couple of drinks, and desert.  The total was a little over 3000
calories, including the drinks.  This I expected.

What I didn't expect was that it looks like my normal daily meals add up to
only about 1300 calories total.  This is not much.  The app suggests
2500, and that's in line with what my research said I should be doing.

In addition to not eating stuff that isn't healthy, I'm also doing the
traditional starving myself to lose weight, thing.  But I'm not worried so
much as I'm fascinated.  I'm not hungry most of the time, and if I am, I eat
something.

I doubt I'll keep this up.  I suck at doing daily things like this.  But for
a couple of days, this is enlightening.
