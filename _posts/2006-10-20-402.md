I don't generally talk about work on this blog, but since this is kinda big news,
I'll talk about work just this once.

Today, I'm leaving EMC\|SMARTS, after just over 3 and a half years of working here.
I started with SMARTS as a Sales Engineer, and after two years of that, moved into
Professional Services (consulting) just about the time EMC Corp bought SMARTS.
That acquisition didn't really affect me at all, job-wise.  I was happy at EMC\|SMARTS
thru my whole tenure there.  The idiot-quotient was relatively low even.

The new job is with a company called
<a href="http://www.realops.com" title="RealOps Inc">RealOps</a>.  It is not in
the network management space, where I've spent the last 10 years of my career, but
being automation, is still within the larger "enterprise management" space.

I'm looking forward to the change, and hope it is good for me.  EMC was not overly
offensive as large companies go, but I am looking forward to working in a smaller
company again.
