I wasn't aware people were still committing fraud on paper, I thought they had totally moved into the online realm.  But some time this week, I got a chain letter in my snail mail.  A pyramid letter, really.  "Remove the person's name at #1, and move all other names up one number (#2 becomes #1, #3 becomes #2, etc.) and add your name and address as #6.... then send to 200 other people."

The letter even gives a company with mailing lists where you can get 200 names and addresses.  I figure this company actually started this letter in the first place.  But I figured I can find 200 addresses myself.  I'll start with all 50 state's attorney generals, postal officials, law enforcement, .....
