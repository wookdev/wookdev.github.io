Doctor appointment today.  I had a black spot on my right arm.  A bunch of small spots making up a larger spot, really, and all black with what looked like bruising around it.  During a checkup in Jan, my doctor  sent me to a dermatologist to have it checked.

Today, that dermatologist, took it off my arm, in a minor bit of surgery.

And now I have a 3" x 4" pressure dressing on my arm, which makes me wonder just how much he removed.  It doesn't really hurt, tho it is sore some.  I guess I'll find out what it looks like tomorrow when I can shower and change the dressing to something a little less obnoxious.

In the meantime, it bit the doctor removed goes to a pathology lab to check to make sure it isn't dangerous.

Now, I just gotta line up a sleep study...

That sounds scary. Any word on how the labs came back?
