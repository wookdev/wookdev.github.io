Returned from Pittsburgh last night. Had a good time with the family. Much
turkey was consumed by all.

Helen is in town this week. Went out last night, though I got there late. Had
a good time with Helen, Christine, and Michael. Hope to catch up with her again
during the week.

Today, I mostly napped. Then Rob came over and we watched the Sopranos. Now,
I'm doing assorted housekeeping on the web site.
