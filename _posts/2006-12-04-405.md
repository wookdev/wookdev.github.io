Okay, I find this funny.

On web servers, the error code that signals "Page Not Found" is number 404.  That also happens to be the number of the Munged.Org blog entry for my birthday post last from last week.

Subtle, but I'm smiling at the couple of obvious jokes about my birthday not being found.
