I've been home a week now, and I'm still not sleeping during normal hours, and I've still got a bad case of digestive problems.  I left the 3 days of Cipro at home accidentally, so I took it Sat/Sun/Mon/Tues, and I'm still not right.  Friday, I went to the walk-in clinic to ask them what the hell I could do to stop feeling like crap, and maybe get back on a sleeping-at-night kind of cycle.

I had a moderate fever, and they did blood and other tests.  The doctor prescribed Cipro again just in case, but for 7 days this time.  He said 3 days isn't actually long enough to be useful.

When I went back today to get the blood test results and drop off the other samples he wanted, the doctor said the bloodwork did not indicate anything other than a bacterial infection, which the Cipro should clear up.  No parasites or topical diseases.  Oh joy.  He also said it might take a couple of weeks to feel better, due to the inflammation of the bacterial infection.  More oh joy.
