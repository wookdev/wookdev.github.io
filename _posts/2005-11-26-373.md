Friday night was a good night, after my travails in getting to Vegas were all over, even though it ended early.  I was up at 3:30 AM Vegas time (6:30 in NYC), so lasting until midnight was about right.

I ran around and picked up all the tickets for all the shows for the weekend, the only real work I did all weekend.  Then we saw <a href="http://www.mgmgrand.com/pages/entertainment.asp?link=lafemme">Le Femme</a> at <a href="http://www.mgmgrand.com/">MGM Grand</a>.  I had a burger at <a href="http://www.fatburger.net/">Fatburger</a>.  After loosing some at craps, I turned in.

All in all, a good day.

Saturday is Henry Rawlins for me, and <a href="http://www.avenueq.com/">Avenue Q</a> for the rest of them.  And Emeril's after for dinner.

Thursday evening, before the show, I was going to catch up with Dave, Haley, and Marc for dinner.  They were at a place in the <a href="http://www.montecarlo.com/">Monte Carlo</a>.  But I realized I had to run around at get at least the tickets for <a href="http://www.mgmgrand.com/pages/entertainment.asp?link=lafemme">Le Femme</a> that night (pick up tickets an hour prior to the show) and <a href="http://www.avenueq.com/">Avenue Q</a> (pick up tickets 24 hours before the show).  So I went to the Wynne Resort, then the <a href="http://www.mgmgrand.com/">MGM Grand</a> (where I also got my Ka tickets for the following Friday).  Then, since I'd missed dinner with the crowd, I went across to NY NY for the Zumanity tickets, and then over to Mandalay Bay (after getting lost in Excalibur) to get Henry Rawlins tickets.

I then walked back to the <a href="http://www.mgmgrand.com/">MGM Grand</a> (after getting lost AGAIN in Excalibur) to meet up with the crowd.

I enjoyed <a href="http://www.mgmgrand.com/pages/entertainment.asp?link=lafemme">Le Femme</a>, even having seen it before.  Even though it hasn't changed much.  It was the same as it was last time, though there were a few different acts.  I suspect that some of the acts have specific performers that do them, so as the performers move from Paris to Vegas and back, some of the acts change too.  We didn't see the "I'm a Good Girl" act that we saw the first time I saw it, but it was on the DVD I bought of the Crazy Horse (Paris) show with the same lady that performed it in Vegas the first time we saw it.

On the way back to the <a href="http://www.montecarlo.com/">Monte Carlo</a>, I had a burger at <a href="http://www.fatburger.net/">Fatburger</a>.  I hadn't eaten anything since breakfast in LaGardia.  Across the street from the <a href="http://www.montecarlo.com/">Monte Carlo</a>, it is a "real burger place", unlike say, McDonalds, and more like In-N-Out Burger, though grubbier.  It was **really, really, good.**

There was an abortive movement to go to <a href="http://www.ogvegas.com/">Olympic Gardens</a>, a classy strip club with a male show for the ladies to enjoy upstairs.  But we did play some craps, before I pooped out and turned in for the night.
