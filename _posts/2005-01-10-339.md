Had tons of Holiday Cheer the last 9 days.  It was all a blast.

I'm finally home.  Both flights back were delayed, so I got home later than I'd have liked, but I am home.  And as if NYC was welcoming me home, the taxi I took from LGA to my apartment was a minivan, easy to get into and out of, and with room to stretch out in a little.  It was nice.

To everyone I hung out with: I love you all, and had a great time.  Thanks to Al and Diane for again putting me up in the spare bedroom.  It really does feel as much home as my place here does.

And thank you all for being some of the best people I know.  You guys rock!
