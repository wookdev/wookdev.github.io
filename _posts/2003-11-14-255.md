My company today announced that a lawsuit that had been filed against us had been settled, and "dismissed with prejudice".

I'd never heard that phrase before.  I was guessing that is probably meant that the litigants agreed to think of each other as morons incapable of folding a roadmap, or something. But then I thought it probably had a legal meaning, since lawyers don't make this stuff up just to say it to each other. Lawyers make this stuff up so they can communicate with each other without the masses understanding anything.

A legal friend of mine says it just means that the suit was dismissed for a good reason, and the plaintiff can't turn around and sue again for the same thing.
My friend said she liked my interpretation better.  I know I do, and will continue to think of the people who sued us that way.
