I hope everyone takes a moment today to remember that something horrible happened
15 years ago.  People died in two cities and a remote farm field.
 
But do not dwell on it.  Look to the future.  Know that even tho the news stations will tell you
all about how you aren't safe, they are lying to you to to generate ratings.  You are more
likely to die by being hit by lightning
than in a terrorist attack or in a school shooting.

I don't say this lightly.  I lived in New York the day the Twin Towers fell.  It changed my
life, and my city.  But I am resilient, and so is New York.  I don't know if we are better now,
but I do know we aren't worse.

So remember, but look forward.
