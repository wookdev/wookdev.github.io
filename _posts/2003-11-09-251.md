My friends Anne and Nat invited me to dinner tonight.  Anne was trying out a brisket recipe, that turned out to be really good.  I brought <a href="http://www.verybestbaking.com/products/tollhouse/bake.asp" title="Nestle Toll House">Nestle Toll House, Chocolate Chip Lovers, Ultimate Cookie Dough</a>.  Those cookies were dangerous, since I could actually make them myself if I wanted to.  The brisket I could not make if I wanted to, so I am safe from that.

I unearthed my sword, and brought it along with me.  To say that Nat is into swords is to make an understatement.  He owns a custom sword from <a href="http://www.bugei.com/" title="Bugei Trading Company | The Samurai Superstor">Bugei</a>.  To say its a nice sword would also be understatement.

I was hoping that Nat would show me how I should be taking care of it.  He did, and I'm glad, since I wouldn't have figured it out. Interestingly, he also recognized the fittings on my sword, and pulled out a catalog of similar stuff. We talked about swords for most of the visit, and I was fascinated with all of it.

The best part were videos Nat had on his Mac of guys slicing up rolled up straw mats with swords not so very different from mine.  This just strikes me as a really good use of a sword, if you happen to have one.  Gun owners shoot at a firing range.  Sword owners chop stuff up.
