Due to some problems remaining after I was supposedly cured of India, I had reason to be checked for lactose and gluten intolerance.  I did the lactose test today, and got the results of the gluten blood test as well.

I'm happy to report that I am neither lactose or gluten intolerant.  This is good.  I can continue to eat pizza like it is one of the 4 basic food groups.  (Along with beer, steak, and cocholate-chip cookies.)

I did some research on gluten intolerance, since I knew not what it was.  And that was the first possible health problem I could get that actually freaked me out.  It is brutal.  Basically, all food becomes poisonous.  And it is not just "you can't digest that".  Gluten intolerance can cause nerve damage if you keep consuming it.  And gluten is in EVERYTHING.

The final diagnosis: Eat more fiber.
