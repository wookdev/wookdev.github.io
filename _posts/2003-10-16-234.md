Well, its actually my only favorite cooking site. But what the hell.

<a href="http://eatdangerously.com/">Eat Dangerously</a>

I think I might actually try <a href="http://eatdangerously.com/spaghetti.html">
"Spaghetti That Will Make You Cry"</a> this weekend.

Thanks to my friend Mike who pointed me to this site in a comment to the
[Turkey Nuts][] entry.
