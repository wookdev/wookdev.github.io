Yeah, definitely. Hell. No escaping it at this point.

Got together last night with some ex-softees, including Stu and Bob who were
over from the UK this weekend. Stu brought his girlfriend and Mother over for
a bit of Christmas shopping. We started last night at Swift, a NYU bar that
was cool. Then some people were going to go to McAnne's, which was closed, so
they ended up at the Sheraton for a bit. Then Stu and Bob and I walked over
to Playwrights, had a beer and went our separate ways home.

Today, I'm recovering. Going to do a whole lot of TiVo watching, maybe a movie
or two that I have but haven't watched yet. (Yes, it is a year later, and I
still have not watched all the DVDs I own.) I might also drain the aquarium
today too.
