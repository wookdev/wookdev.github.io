I'm in Chicago, at Dave and Haley's place. Got in last night, after an extremely
mad dash for the airport. Once at the airport, things were okay, though I was
there mostly just in time. As a note, if you are going through Laguardia, noon
seems to be a good time to be there, at least in the Central Terminal. Very
quiet, and relaxed.

I've lost the art of packing for a trip in 10 minutes flat. But the only thing
I left at home accidentally was the power supply for my laptop. Going to have
to see how that works out for tomorrow. I might have to buy one if I'm here
for very long.

Loki is now a six month old puppy. I saw her last when she was a 5 week old
puppy. She still has the paws of a puppy that has more growing to do, and her
parents were about twice her size, overall, I think. She has a black coat, with
brown and white face, paws, and tail. Very cute. And a sweet dog too.
