Here's the promised "news on the job front".

Tomorrow, I start work with [Systems Management Arts][smarts], sometimes
called [SMARTS][smarts].
The "home office" is in White Plains, New York. This is in Westchester
county, the first county north of New York city. I haven't completely got the
commute thing figured out yet, but it is a reverse commute that seems to be
about 40 minutes by Metro North commuter train.

You can follow the ongoing tale, as always, in the journal.
