A semi-trendy dinner on the North side of the river in downtown Chicago.  My mother took me there once, when she lived on Wacker Drive.  It was very good then, and it was very good Saturday morning too.

Marc and Leslie, Dave and Haley, and I were downtown.  We'd done a fancy dinner at Fugu da Chao (or something like that) and some club-hopping the night before and stayed downtown overnight in a Courtyard hotel.

Because I wimped out the night before due to a lingering headache, I was up earlier than anyone else.  I'd already discovered that the only copy of "Pirates of the Caribean" on the hotel video network had a serious tracking problem and wasn't watchable.  Marc called, and deputized me to find a "brunchy/brecky place" for brunch/breakfast.

So I went out exploring

I walked over to the river, then across Michigan Avenue, then up some street to where I could see my mom's old building across the river from where I was and gage where we'd have walked across a bridge.  In all, I walked right to West Egg.

And a good brunchy/brecky was had by all.
