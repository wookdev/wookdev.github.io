title: "iPhone's Visual Voicemail being Audio Only"

So my iPhone had a problem, and I realized it sometime yesterday, when my brother called me back and left a voicemail.  The problem was that Visual Voicemail wasn't working.  Rather than calling voice mail to listen to messages, the iPhone is supposed to have a list of voice mails, and you can just pick which one you want to listen to.  No listening to prompts and pushing 7 to delete the message, or 9 to save it.  Just pick it from the list and push the delete button to make it go away, etc.  Really handy, when it works.

But no, it was working like a normal phone, and actually calling voice mail.  And if there's one thing I can not stand, it would be the iPhone working like a normal phone.

I spent an hour or so  on the phone today with Apple, and then AT&T trying to get this figured out.  Apple said it was an AT&T thing, AT&T said my account was set up correctly.  But nothing made it work as it should.

So then I was out with Marcela tonight, and when I went to show her the phone, and went into voicemail, it asked for a password for voice mail, and after that worked like Visual Voicemail should.
