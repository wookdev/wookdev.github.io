I maintain a mailing list for my mother's side of the family.  One of the odd-ball uses we found for it was a Question of the Week.  We haven't done a QOTW for a while, but then today I got this email from my uncle Ken:

> Time for a more sophisticated QOTW from a real adult.
>
> Yup - this is really a question from my mother - believe it or not.
>
> She claims that Louis, her late second husband, a former turkey rancher, told her years ago that there is a "sophisticated, gourmet" name for turkey nuts, and yes I DO mean turkey nuts. None of us ever heard of it. It's kinda like snails are called "escargot".
>
> Apparently Louis used to go to a turkey convention every year and turkey nuts were considered a real delicacy there, but they had a more sophisticated name. Mom actually tried some while here in California with Louis years ago. They were called turkey nuts.
>
> Mom insisted that I solicit an answer from all you pros out there. Good luck looking THAT up on Google or elsewhere.
>
> In case there is no real answer (go figure) we encourage some imaginative answers, perhaps even some frivilous humor.
>
> Some already mentioned possibilities are turkey "Gems", turkey "Jewels", and the most popular - "turkey balls". Somehow I doubt that they qualify as the "gourmet" expression of delicacy.
>
> Really - she insisted I do this.

> I gotta go home for dinner now.....Bye

Google is of course, all powerfull (All hail Google!), and I was bored, so read on for what I found.

Give the lady a hand, folks... just wash it afterwards.

There is in fact a culinary term for turkey nuts, and that term is "Animelles", a french word for "testicle".  I could be wrong, but I found this word on a site about turkey nuts.

<a href="http://www.psgrill.net/Encyclopedia/ENCYCLOPEDIA.html">This site</a> says:
<dl>
<dt>**animelles** (Fr.)</dt>
<dd>The culinary term for testicles of animals, especially rams; animelles are less popular in Europe today than formerly but still common in the Middle East; in Italy, animelle means sweetbreads.</dd>
</dl>

I also have to include the definition from <a href="http://www.hoboes.com/html/Diner/oysters.shtml">this site</a>:
<dl>
<dt>**Animelles**: (U.S. fry)</dt>
<dd>Culinary term for the testicles of male animals, in particular those of lambs and sheep. In the past animelles were very much in vogue in France, Spain, and Italy.</dd>
</dl>

I included it so I can wonder out loud what the testicles of **female** animals might be called?

From <a href="http://www.funlinked.com/testicle/fact.html">these people</a> we find:

> The Euphemisms
>
> A testicle by any other name...
>
> * fry (lamb, calf, turkey, rooster, pig, bull, etc.)
> * rocky mountain oysters
> * Montana tendergroin
> * bulls jewels
> * barnyard jewels
> * cowboy caviar
> * farm oysters
> * swinging beef
> * Animelles - fr. (testicles)
> * bollocks

I like the third from the bottom best.

I'd also rather not bring to your attention (but I can't help myself):

<a href="http://www.turkey-testicle-festival.com/index.html" title="Turkey Testicle Festival Official Site">Turkey Testicle Festival Official Site</a>

Yes, you read that right, this is a turkey testicle festival.  Nobody under 21 allowed in, for no reason I could determine from the site itself.  There are quite a few festivals surrounding eating testicles in general, but this was the only one I found in my short and incomplete search specifically to turkey gonads.  They even have a turkey testicle song.

Wook, here are some addresses of places that sell, Rocky Mountain Turkey things.... (UGH! I like ya wook, but I'll never try this stuff...)  Sorry, no luck finding the "gourmet" name yet...

Now, I might be going overboard with this one, but I think I'll cook this turkey this year....
