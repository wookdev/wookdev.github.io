Bought it last night at CompUSA, when I picked up another MacBook Pro power brick.

I have no intention of installing it on my laptop, or my home machine for that matter, until some problems are resolved with it.  Probably around the time 10.5.1. comes out.

So far, all the in-depth reviews are treating it well, it seems.  The underpinnings are improved, but the actual interface is a step back in usability.

I installed 10.5 on my MBP17" and its awesome.. I find it a lot quicker than Tiger.

My one gripe with it.. is how it displays mounted network drives in Finder. I liked the old way of showing you the share, not the new way of clicking the server name, selecting the required share in the right pane and then it showing you the files....

Other than that.. Ive not experienced anything that makes me think it was a bad choice to install.

As I've learned more about it, my issues with it have lessened.  Now I'm probably not going to get around to installing it until I get moved, just because I don't have time.
