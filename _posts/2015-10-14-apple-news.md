I upgraded the iPhone and iPad to iOS 9 a couple of days after it was available.
I upgraded to 9.0.1 a week later, and 9.0.2 a week after that.  I was looking forward
to Apple News as a news aggregator, a place to find news all in one place and have
it learn what I liked and expand my horizons.

I should have known this was not going to happen, but I'm sometimes blinded by
unreasonable optimism.

Favorites come in 3 flavors:

1. News Topics, which I presume are curated topic lists
1. Publications, like the NYTimes, WaPo, Ars, Quartz, etc
1. Favorited articles

When first used Apple News asks you to pick some favorites from the first two
categories.  Then it never shows you anything else.

When I remove all the favorites no new news shows up.  I thought some would,
because I've marked a bunch of articles as favorites, and you can't see those or remove
the favorite status if you didn't also bookmark them.  But nothing showed up.  I went
6 days wondering why News was always picking the same articles, until I noticed they
were all from 6 days ago.  When I added the NYTimes back as a favorite, suddenly there
were 80 new NYT articles for me to read.

This is not what I want to happen.  I want it to start showing me some of
everything, and I
mean EVERYTHING, and then slowly remove stuff from my "For You" that I never read ever.
This is not how it works tho.

I originally picked the NYTimes, WaPo, Quartz, Vox, Slate, and "Space", and "Techology".
Within 2 days, half the "For You" feed was articles about Pluto and Mars, with the
occasional review of The Martian.  The other half were full of GOP presidential
candidates, which is strange because I never read any of them at any time.

So I started over, and picked all the major newspapers.  Then I stopped finding any
articles I wanted to read at all.  I removed them all, and this is when I noticed
that you have to have some favorites or you don't get any news at all.

I continue to experiment with it.  Maybe the number of the articles I've favorited
isn't big enough.  One of the topics you can favorite is called simply "News", and
that's the only favorite I've selected right now.  I'll see how this goes.

Or maybe my interests just aren't wide enough and I should go back to reading Slashdot.
