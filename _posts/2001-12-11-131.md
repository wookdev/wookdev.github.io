I'm back from two-plus weeks of vacation in the Southwest
USA. I spent Thanksgiving in San Francisco with Dave and Haley, then spent
some time driving around. Stops were Yosemite National Park, Death Valley,
Las Vegas, Ventura California, with a crowning drive up the Pacific Coast
Highway from Ventura back to San Francisco.

It was a good vacation. Yosemite, Death Valley, and the
PCH drive were all fantastically beautiful. Las Vegas was fun, mostly
because I was there alone, so I could do all the things I wanted to do.
I saw 6 shows in my 4 nights there.

Anyway, there are pictures up in the <a href="/photo/index.html">travel</a>
section. Note they aren't what I consider ready for display yet, but I won't
be able to get them processed for a while, so I am just dumping them here so
people can at least see something.
