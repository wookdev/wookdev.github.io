I was walking around Penn Station today.  I walked past the <a href="http://www.hotelpenn.com/" title="Hotel Pannsylvania">Hotel Pennsylvania</a>, owner of the old phone number "Pennsylvania 6-5000" made famous by the Glenn Miller Orchestra.  I walked past <a href="http://www.macys.com/" title="Macys">Macys Herald Square</a>, the largest store in the world.  I walked past 2 Penn Plaza, the building I first worked in when I arrived in New York City 11 years ago.

Then I walked into 11 Penn Plaza, where I now work.  Same job, I'm just not based in White Plains any more.  I woke up at 7:30 this morning, and was in the office by 9.  Normally, I'd be on a 7:44 train to be actually seated at my desk in White Plains at 9.

And, it felt like going home, in a way.  A few of the places I used to eat and hang out are still there.  A few aren't.
