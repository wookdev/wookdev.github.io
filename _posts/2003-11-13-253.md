<a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/clonewars/index.html" title="Star Wars: Clone Wars">Star Wars: Clone Wars</a> has started on the <a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/" title="Cartoon Network">Cartoon Network</a>.  A bunch of 5 minute shows, it is being called an "epic micro-series".  I think that is my new, favorite, oxymoron.

And so far, 5 shows in, this thing sucks.

The only reason I'll keep watching it is that the Tivo Guide has it listed, which I hadn't expected to happen for a 5 minute show.
