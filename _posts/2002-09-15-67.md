I bought suits for work. Actually I bought a whole new business dress wardrobe.
I'm going to toss the stuff currently in my closet. Haven't worn any of it for
a long time. None of it fits me any more. Salvation army or Goodwill can have
the lot.

Now I'll just have to re-do my business casual stuff, and I'm set to be the
US pre-sales guy of the month for Isomair.

Out with a couple of friends last night. Sean's birthday is today. It was a
nice night.

Going to watch the Sopranos tonight, as much as I'd rather not. Way to much
hype. Anything hyped this much as to suck. At least that is the way movies work.
