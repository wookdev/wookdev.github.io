I'm bummed. 50 gallons of water come through my ceiling from
an aquarium in the apartment above me that pops a filter hose. My DVD and CD
players are full of water. Water stains are now featured prominently in my living
room decore.

I leave tomorrow for Columbia, Missouri. Then Des Moines for
my sister's wedding. Then London for a meeting and some assorted work that can't
be done here.
