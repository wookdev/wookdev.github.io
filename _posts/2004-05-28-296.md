A <a href="http://www.pbs.orb/">PBS</a> show called
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/">Frontline</a> has a report coming
out soon called <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/music/"
title="The Way The Music Died">The Way the Music Died</a> which has
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/music/interviews/crosby.html">an
interview with David Crosby</a> that describes the problems with the current music
industry.  He describes how it came to be, and why it is wrong.  An incredible
interview, really.  Anyone with half a brain already knows all this, but it is
good to see it all said in context, in one place.  Required reading.

I saw this on <a href="http://slashdot.org/" title="News for nerds,
stuff that matters">Slashdot</a>, but had to make sure it was posted here too.
