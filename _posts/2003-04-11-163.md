Here's a picture I took, that I kind of like

<img alt="265631-R1-E020_2.jpg" src="/pics/265631-R1-E020_2.jpg" width="640" height="426" border="0" />

Taken with: Niikon N80, 50mm/f1.4 lense, probably at f1.4 on Fuji Velvia 50.  This shot was then photoshopped into back and white and cropped.

I kinda like it.
