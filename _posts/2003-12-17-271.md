Got up at "Oh My God Its Five AM" this morning to make the flight to Pitt.  The day was a complete bust, work-wise.  I would have rather stayed home without Internet access.

There was a happy ending to today.  I met up with my brother, who took me to the <a href="http://www.hardrock.com/locations/cafes/cafes.aspx?lc=PITT" title="Hard Rock Cafe - Cafes - HRC Pittsburgh">Pittsburg, Hard Rock Cafe</a>.  I had ribs that were pretty good.  It was a good night.

I'm thinking of starting a Hard Rock Cafe sweatshirt collection, but only from places nobody in their right mind would go to just to visit a Hard Rock Cafe.  But this would require going to these places, and I'm not sure I'm up for that, if I'm not called to them by business.  Maybe some other time.
