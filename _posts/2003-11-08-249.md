Very soon, munged.org will be moving from the current hosting provider to <a href="http://www.liquidweb.com/" title="Liquid Web Inc.">these guys</a>.  I wasn't going to post anything about this event, until it was a done deal.

But I signed up this morning, and 10 minutes later, they called to verify that I actually placed an order.  So far, they gets points for being prompt, and doing the work on a weekend morning.  But they don't get raves or anything for that.

What they DO get raves for is that the guy that called me actually **pronounced my last name correctly**.  And he wasn't stuttering like he was't sure if that was the correct way to pronounce it either.

**This NEVER happens.**

I've hardly gotten signed up, and already I'm feeling pretty welcome in the state of Michigan.
