Just got back from seeing [The Martian][], the movie mentioned
[two posts back][].  I'm going to show a serious nerd streak here, but I am what
I am.

## Short review:

 I liked it.

## Longer review:

I liked it.  I didn't love it.

I went into it knowing that it would not be the book, but I was made
a little optimistic by the fact that almost everthing in the trailers I saw I remembered
as being in the book.  It mostly delivered, tho parts were confusing.

One of the things that is really good about the book is the technical accuracy, while
managing to be a gripping story with drama and suspence.  The movie couldn't have all
that in it, but it went into some of the technical stuff and then did it so badly that
it removed me from the moment.

The other thing I hated was that characters seems to be doing things they weren't
technically supposed to do.  Some of this was just because I knew who said which
lines in the book, and in the move someone else said it.  This is minor.

More major is when character roles get mixed up because the big name actor has to have
specific lines, and be the one to save the day.  This is standard movie crap and is a
standard gripe of mine.  Lewis has
to save Mark at the end, because Jessica Chastain is the biggest name in that scene.
Teddy has to
be the one doing all the new conferences, and gets most of Annie's good lines, because
Jeff Bridges is the biggest name in the earth part of the movie.  Never mind
Beck is the EVA specialist, and Annie is the media relations person.  I suspect
that the only reason Teddy didn't fly up and save Watney himself was because they'd
already made a big deal about the distances and times it took to travel to Mars.

The book doesn't suffer from "the biggest actor is always better at something than
the person that's supposed to do it", because it is a book.  The movie does, and I
don't think it needed to, or should have.  I have this same complaint about movies
that don't come from books, or come from books I haven't read.

## The Good:

The acting.  Matt Damon did a good job of being the optimistic smart-ass from the
book, without being unreasonably happy at all the things that happen to him that
aren't all that happy.  Everyone else delivered, for the most part too.

I am often of the opinion that Matt Damon is right only for certain roles.  When
I found out he was cast as Mark Watney for this movie, I didn't think he was the
right actor.  But having now seen the movie, I gotta say: he was perfect.

Ridley Scott made an absolutely beautiful movie.  The whole thing was visually
awesome.  I also feel like this was the first good movie Scott has made in a while.

Despite the nit picking I do below, I think they did a really good job of removing
aspects of the story in the book to get this to fit into a movie and still be faithful
to the book.  We didn't need the hydrogen scare, or all the time Watney spends in the
detached airlock.  The pop tents and all the ways they are used wasn't needed.  It
would have taken a mini-series to do the whole trip to the [Schiaparelli Crater][], with
the dust storm and the roll-over, and I didn't miss any of it at all in the movie.

I also liked that Watney just would sit and look at the scenery in his suit, or sleep
under the Rover, even tho in the book it is stated that hey only has 1500 hours of
EVA time.  This departure from technical accuracy made me smile, and identify with
Watney all the more, because I would totally blow my EVA time looking at the scenery.

## Let the Nit-Picking Begin:

For the most part, it had the things in it that had to be in it.  But some of
the choices
of what to keep and what to drop for time confused me.  There were things
that worked really well in the book, that didn't work at all in the movie.

The "Fonz" joke didn't work at all in the movie.  There was no sign saying "Aaaayyy",
and you can clearly see his face, making Annie requesting a picture of his face a
blunder.

I didn't
really buy Jessica Chastain as a misson commander, but otherwise I think she did a
good job.

The explosion from his attempt at reducing hydrazine was actually two things in
the book combined in a way that made no sense in the movie.  He said the explosion
was from the
oxygen coming from his mask, but I don't remember him wearing one.  Even if he had
been, making water by reducing the hydrazine and burning the hydrogen requires
oxygen in the atmosphere, so a little more coming from his breath wouldn't cause an
explosion he wasn't going to have otherwise.

Having said that, I agree the "Great Hydrogen Scare of Sol 37" was too technical to
be in the film.  As much as I liked that explosion and his log entry about it, I
would have skipped the whole thing for the movie, and just let him make water without
any drama.

Why did he have to cut a hole in the rover and make a balloon?  In the book it is
because the life support equipment is too tall to fit in the trailer rover.  In
the movie,
all that stuff is outside on the back.  They could have left that out completely.
The only possible reason to have it would have been for him to kill Pathfinder with
the drill, but they didn't do that either.

For that matter, why is "hab canvas" really obviously just plastic sheeting?  They
couldn't come up with something more "canvas-y" looking?

Why does Hermes, a nuclear-powered spacecraft, have
enormous solar panels?  It doesn't need any, it has a reactor for power.
They even mention sealing off
the reactor room when they blow the VAL.  Who wasn't paying attention here.

There was enough drama in the recovery at the end without Commander Lewis having to
horn in on the operation because "I'm not losing another crewman!"  I wish the movie
makers could have just trusted that part and let Beck to the job he was the best
trained for.

I also thought actually doing the "Iron Man" thing was bullshit.  There was no
need for it.  Again, they should have trusted the story.

Sadly, despite Ridley Scott's incredible scenery, he doesn't know how to use 3D any
better than your average movie director.  Nothing is added to this film by it being 3D.

## The Outright Bad

The character of Annie Montrose was butchered.  I understand that you can't have a
strong female lead dropping f-bombs all over the place and still get a PG-13 rating.
But she could have still been a strong character.

Venkat Kapoor from the book, a hindu, was renamed "Vincent Kapoor" for the movie
and made the son of a hindu and a presbyterian (or was it protestant) in the movie.
In this day and age, when we are trying to
foster acceptance of multiculturalism, this change smacked of giving in to assholes
and bigots.  I was not amused, and don't care that the movie makers don't want to be
controversial.

## Technical Stuff Even The Book Got Wrong

The two things I know about are:

The atmosphere on Mars is so thin that no sandstorm is ever going to be strong
enough to tip over a MAV, or cause a communication dish to get ripped out and
fly thru the air.  Yes, things will get dark and solar panels get covered in dust.
No, they don't don't show up as a massive wall of evil coming over a distant
mountain.

"Hab canvas" would not rip and launch the airlock like a cannon.  The stuff would
be designed to give slowly, as a small hole that just gets bigger over time if
not taken care of.  The air pressure in the hab would not be enough to move anything
as heavy as the airlock assembly.  A rip would just vent all the air around it.

## Two Things The Movie Got Right, The Book Got Wrong

Rovers were flatbed "trucks" in the movie.  This makes sense.  The rovers had no cargo
capacity in the book.  Watney had to improvise shelves and stack stuff on the roof in
the book.  The pre-supply modules
were landed softly, but would have been scattered around a ways.  The crew would need
some way to carry everything back to the site.  A flatbed, a trailer, and a crane would
be super-helpful.

At JPL, they would have totally used the mock-up of the Pathfinder to figure out how
to use the camera to communicate.  It was never mentioned in the book.  Tho maybe, it
was cut for word count.
