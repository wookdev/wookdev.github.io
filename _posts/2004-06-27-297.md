title: "DemiCon Photo Update"

Yes, I said 2 weeks on DemiCon photos.  But I didn't anticipate how little time I'd have to work on the processing of the photos after DemiCon.  Things have been way more busy than they really should be.

But, while I don't have a web site ready yet, the photos are up where you can get at them.  Go go:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.shutterfly.com/pro/Munged/DC15" title="DemiCon 15 Photos">http://www.shutterfly.com/pro/Munged/DC15</a></blockquote>

There, you will find the hall and masquerade costumes up, where you can get prints.  Shutterfly isn't the best place to display photos, so there are web galleries coming.  The web will include snapshots from the rest of the con too.

When the photos do go up here, they will live at:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.wookphoto.com/DemiCon/DemiCon-15" title="DemiCon 15">/photo/demi15/</a></blockquote>

There isn't so much as even a placeholder page there, yet, but that too shall come.
