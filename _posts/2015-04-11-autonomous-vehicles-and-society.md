title: Authonomous Vehicles and Society

[This article][robohub article] on RoboHub starts making an interesting point, and then
completely misses the
bigger picture.  Yes, there is more to Autonomous cars than just the technology
involved.  But the impact to society isn't just how the vehicles are used.
There are [1.7 million OTR truck drivers in the US][OTR BLS Stats].  What
happens when they are all out of work?  And taxi drivers?  There are [233 thousand
taxi and chauffeurs][Taxi BLS Stats] too.

I've read a lot of [Kurt Vonnegut][]'s books.  I hated them, mostly.  But his theme of
"what to do with useless people" is going to become a very import problem for our
society in the next 20 or 30 years.  Probably sooner.

This isn't just truck and taxi drivers.  As online stores like Amazon start to
deliver purchases to you faster than you could get to the store to pick them up 
yourself, people will be out of retail jobs as well.  Factories are already getting
more and more automated.  When Apple announce they were bringing some manufacturing
back into the US, what they didn't say was that almost all of it was going to be
automated.

A massive percentage of the world's population is comprised of people who's sole
talent is that they can follow directions.  Automation will take those jobs slowly,
but surely.  The US has a long history of self-reliance, and limited socialized
benefits.  The transition to a population largely unemployed will be rough.
