[So.][event]

No new iPad. I'm bummed. I need to replace mine so I have one that works
with my Phantom.

## iPhone

The iPhone has been a mature platform for years. Improvements to it are strictly
evolutionary now, not revolutionary. So we have the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
Bigger screens. Faster. Better camera. Better battery life.
Yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda.

No news there worth remembering. I'll probably be getting one, because I want
the motion co-processor so GPS stops sucking the life from the battery.

## AppleWatch.

Looks cool. I'm sure it will be fun. I might get one. I might not. Ally is all hot
to have one for the health stuff, and I might even get it for her. I've needed a watch
for a long time. So maybe. We shall see.

## ApplePay.

NFC is only about the short-range communication between two devices. Two phones,
a phone and a computer, a phone and an NFC receiver, whatever. NFC can be used for
anything. Payments. Opening hotel room doors. Sending files or contacts.
Whatever you can think of. Samsung uses it to transfer assorted data between phones in
a nifty sort of way that [iPhones accomplish with BlueTooth and WiFi][airdrop].

In order to make
ApplePay, Apple started with NFC, but had to implement everything from there thru the
retailer to the banks at the back end. Security, the token implementation,
encryption, all of it. This stuff all exists already, but until now it has never
been implemented in the USA on the scale Apple seems to have managed.

Apple got agreements from retailers to put the NFC readers in their stores so there
would be places for people to use ApplePay. That right there might be the single
most important accomplishment of all of ApplePay. That's what adoption looks like for
a payment system: retailers willing to use it. I'd challenge you to name another
company that could pull that off.

Systems like ApplePay exist in other parts of the world already. Japan and
Taiwan (and probably others) have had this kind ofsystem for years. Those systems are
driven by government bodies that set it all up. In the USA, Google and Microsoft have
both started contact-less payment systems on their devices. The Google system has
been around since 2009 or so. But have you heard of it, or used it anywhere in
the USA? It might be unfair, but it seems like only Apple has the mind share to
legitimize this kind of thing in this country.

Going forward, it will be interesting to see how it evolves.

And how will ApplePay be fit in to places
where something similar already exists, like Taiwan and Japan? My guess is the
iPhone will just support the existing systems, but who knows, there might be room for
improving the user experience of them.
