[Roger Zelazny's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Zelazny "Roger Zelazny on Wikipedia") "[Chronicles of Amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Amber "Chronicles of Amber on Wikipedia")" made it to ebook stores finally.  I picked them up and am re-reading them.  It's been a long time.  One of my favorite quotes of all time comes from "Trumps of Doom", the first book of the second cycle, focussing on Merlin.

The quote:

> Grief and anger shrink my world, and I resent this. They seem to paralyze my memory of happier times, of friends, places, things, options. Squeezed by the grip of intense, unsettling emotion, I grow smaller in my single-mindedness. I suppose it is partly because I have discarded a range of choices, impairing in some measure my freedom of will. I donâ€™t like this, but after a point I have small control over it. It makes me feel that I have surrendered to a kind of determinism, which irritates me even more. Then, vicious cycle, this feeds back into the emotion that drives me and intensifies it. The simple way of ending this situation is the headlong rush to remove its object. The difficult way is more philosophical, a drawing back, the reestablishment of control. As usual, the difficult way is preferable. A headlong rush may also result in a broken neck.

From Zelazny, Roger.  "Trumps of Doom"
