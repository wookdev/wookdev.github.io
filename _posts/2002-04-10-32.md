Still can't find the W-2 forms. This is beginning to worry me. They are here.
Somewhere. In an envelope, that I would have taken out of my laptop bag with
a bunch of other stuff I can't find either.

Reading the last Harry Potter book.

Finished all the Kage Baker books in the Mendoza series. I want more of them.

Got the new web site uploaded. Took all night. There are still some rough edges
(read: embarasments) to take care of. But this is the site.

So, the reason you've never seen any of this stuff before now, is that this
page, and the rest of the IIRC section only arrived out where people can see
it, today.

I hope you enjoy it.
