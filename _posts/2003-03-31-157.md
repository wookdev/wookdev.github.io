It was nice last week in Reston, a DC suburb in Northern Virginia.  It rained in New York City all weekend, though it was warm.  So what do I find back down in DC when I landed last night?

Four inches of snow.

When I walked out of the airport, the first thing I noticed was the cold.  I have started wearing my light leather jacket, and it wasn't quite up to what I encountered as I stepped out of the terminal to find my ride.  My second clue that snow had happened should have been the snow on the trunks and bumpers of cars, but that fact was recorded by my brain without registering the implications.

So, I was kind of startled when on the trip out to my hotel the ground was white the farther out towards Dulles we got.  (The reasons for flying into National, and staying near Dulles are long, tedious, and boring, but good reasons nevertheless.)

My co-workers assure me that they didn't order this snow just for me.  They keep saying "This is almost April, we shouldn't be able to have snow now."  Ah, but snow, like shit, happens sometimes.

Still, I have my camera with me this time, finaly. So I took a couple of pictures of it, just because.
