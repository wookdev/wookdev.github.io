Intestingly enough, I have a report that some parts of this page do not show up in the Opera web browser.  I check this site with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino/">Camino</a>, which is a Macintosh-specific Mozilla-based browser.  So if you can't see the archive and section links on the left, then please let me know.

I checked, and both IE 5.2.2 and Mozilla 1.2.1 for the Mac can see the site as it was intended to be seen. If you have some other half-baked browser and you can't see Munged.Org in all its glory, you will just have to deal with it until I can fix it later.  I'm leaving for work.

The old site is saved here [Ed: Well, it was there, but now it isn't.] if it helps get to content you want to see.  But that site is dead, and will not be updated.
