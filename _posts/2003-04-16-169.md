I feel like Steve Martin jumping up and down screaming "The new phonebooks are here!
The new phonebooks are here!"  My excitement is over something a little less strange
than knowing you are somebody because your name is finally in the phonebook, though
no less exciting for me.

My <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/usa_product/product.jsp?cat=1&grp=2&productNr=25206">
new camera</a> arrived today.  All the associated parts (2nd battery,
<a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/usa_product/product.jsp?cat=1&grp=5&productNr=1923NCP">shorter
lens</a>, battery pack, etc) all arrived last week, and have been sitting forlornly on
my coffee table waiting to be useful.  Well, today is that day.  As soon as the
batteries are charged ("Damnit!  You mean I have to WAIT?!?") I'll be set.
