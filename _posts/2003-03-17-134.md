So I'm sitting here, with the TV on, for no reason at all.  And the Powerpuff Girls is up next.  And I start thinking about how it would be cool to see the one where the girls decide they can be better heros if they have cool costumes and stuff.  (We also find out where all the monsters come from.)

And it is on!  My second favorite PPG episode.

This is the one where Blossom decides to be "Liberty Belle", and drive a long car into the city, instead of flying.  She gets stuck in traffic on the way.

Buttercup is "Mange", a dark, tormented hero, that doesn't go out in the daylight.  So she doesn't get there until after dark.

And Bubbles is "Harmony Buny", who rides a pogo stick to get into Townsville to fight the monster. 

And the monster's name is Steve.

So the monster is destroying Townsville for two days of no-shows.

I wish I had thought up "Mange".  Such a great dark hero name.
