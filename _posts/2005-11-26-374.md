I hate slot machines.

The casinos scatter them around by the hundreds.  No human interaction, just sit and push buttons hoping that this one will give you a jackpot.  And people make fun of me for playing computer games.  At least I'm having fun with other humans.

And if the Wheel of Fortune slots weren't bad enough, now there is a Star Wars slot machine.  &lt;shudder&gt;

My other problem with slots is the noise factor.  Las Vegas is supposed to be erotic, adventurous, and glitzy.  It is not supposed to sound like a bad pinball machine.  I can deal with the thronging millions, with the advertisements covering everything.  I dislike the sounds of slots.  I could stand this place for more than 3 days at a time if not for the fucking slots.

Yes, you guessed it.  I've been 24 hours now, and I'm already tired of it.  Good thing I'm having a blast otherwise.
