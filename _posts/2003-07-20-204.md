I'm reading Bill Bryson's "A Short History of Nearly Everything".  It is one of those survey of science history books.  It is a fun book to read, done in a writing style that is easy to read.  Bill Bryson is an interesting author, and I recommend him.

Anyway, in the chapter about oceanography, Bill relates that we know very little about the oceans of the world.  In fact, we know more about the planets of our solar system than we know about how our oceans work.  In fact, we know so little about our oceans, that one of the things that taught us the most recently was tracking 34,000 hockey gloves that fell off a container ship.  They've been floating around the ocean ever since, showing us the effects of surface currents.

I read about this in Bill's book on my way home Friday night.

Then in my friend Susan's gack! mailing list this week, she had <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,996684,00.html">this entry</a>, pointing to the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">Guardian</a>.  The article is about rubber ducks, but mentions the hockey gloves.

One other interesting point is that 10,000 cargo containers fall off ships every year.  This is 10,000 containers the size of a semi trailer.  This can't be good.  You'd think the people who own the contents would be up in arms about it.  The oceans probably would be happier if they were.
