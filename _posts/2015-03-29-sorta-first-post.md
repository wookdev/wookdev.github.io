I keep doing this...

Yeah, so not so much a litteral "first post", first post.  More of a first post that didn't get copied
from some prior
version of some prior blog. The kind of "first post" you get when you've set up a new account at a new webhost,
and have to type something into it as a test.

This site is hosted via [GitHub's Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages"). The docs that make
it up are stored in a github repository, and from there show up on a web site via
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and related technologies.  It has the main advantage that it is
free, and the secondary advantage of being easy.

Supposedly easy, anyway. It would seem I've traded the complexities of Squarespace for
the complexities of having to follow filename and markdown formatting guidelines by hand.

Squarespace is really nice,
and generated a very pretty web site with minimal work.  But the behind-the-scenes stuff is 
way more focussed on how things look, than generating actual written words.  It gets in
the way.

To use github pages, I need to create a text file for each post. Formatting of the pages
can be done via [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). I do this
on my computer, commit the changes to the local git repo,
and then sync the repo with github.  Github magically notices the changes (if I do it
right) does the Jekyll thing and
re-creates the site.

This might not actually be any easier in the end. Or this might be just what I need
to make it so I can do this again. Or or, I might not be able to actively blog ever
again, because Facebook ruined me. I have until my Squarespace subscription
expires towards the end of April to figure this all out.
