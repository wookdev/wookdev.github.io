A couple of things have come to me recently.  I thought I'd share them here.

Firstly, a very cool bit of art, the <a href="http://www.eviltree.de/zoomquilt/zoom.htm" title="ZOOMQUILT | A collaborative art project">ZOOMQUILT</a>.  If you drag from top to bottom, it zooms out.  Drag from bottom to top to zoom in.

And now, two Shakespeare jokes.  Done in L33T speak.  They move fast, but I found them hilarious. <a href="http://www.frashii.com/romjul.swf">Romeo and Juliet</a>, and <a href="http://www.frashii.com/hamlet.swf">Hamlet</a>.
