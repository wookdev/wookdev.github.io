I deleted my @wookman Twitter account.

I wasn't using it.  I mostly followed local law enforcement, so I could see when they were
doing roadblocks and speed traps.  That didn't happen often enough when I drive to make it
worth it.

The account I'll miss is [InternetOfShit][].  You don't realize just how stupid most
"Internet Of Things" really are until you see it all en-mass.  Tho [Bloomberg got into][]
it with the Juicero, which was hilarious.

The other reason is one I've been talking about for years: I just don't get Twitter as
anything other than a marketing platform.  Want to crow about your product, but don't
want to spend money on press releases?  Tweet.  Want to publicly complain about something?
Tweet.  (Something I've been guilty of doing, and it didn't help.)

But for keeping in touch with people?  Impossible, unless you can like scrolling thru
8000 tweets to find them all.

There's also the fact that bullies and trolls that make Twitter money, will be allowed
to bully and troll while the rest of us get slapped down for lesser abuses of
the Twitter terms of service.

So I'm out.
