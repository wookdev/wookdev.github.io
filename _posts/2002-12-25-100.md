Merry Christmas!

Today I did more movies, and hung out with Susan most of the day.

I saw "Solaris" by myself at noon. This movie is very much like 2001
was. Slow, atmospheric, and beautifully done. It was okay if you like pretentious
movies.

Then I saw "Far From Heaven" with Susan and her friend Ada. This
movie was a chick-flick, but at least it was a good one. The amount of "niceness"
coming out of the screen had me ready to gag myself with a tree stump about
halfway through, but then things started turning very difficult for the characters,
and that solved that problem.

Then Susan and I had chinese food, which made the day an official "New
York Christmas". NYC shuts down on Christmas day, as you might expect.
However, there is a fair population of non-christians in this city, so there
are quite a number of people who have to find something to do. The tradition
is movies and chinese food.
