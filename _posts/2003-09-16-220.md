In addition to the first sign of the appocalypse seen last week, there is a new one:
<blockquote>Lewis has a girlfriend</blockquote>
How many signs does there have to be before we should really worry about the world ending?

Oops! I used "there" where I should have used "their". Sorry.

By the way, not only does Lewis have a girlfriend, but she's very attractive with a good sense of humor, and doesn't seem weirded out by hanging with his crazy friends.

It really is scary, isn't it?

Yep.

I even met her once (or twice) way, way, Way, WAY, back when.  Her sister was a friend of mine in high school.

I remember her as being nice, though I hardly talked to her.  Hope to meet her (again) at New Year's.
