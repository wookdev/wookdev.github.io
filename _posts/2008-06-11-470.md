The first weekend I was here, I arranged a trip to go to Mysore, a city not to far away from Bangalore.  Mysore has two famous palaces, and a bunch of famous temples.  I got up early Saturday morning, and a driver took me to Mysore and showed me the sights.

I didn't get as many photos as I wanted of this whole trip, due to almost anything worth photographing still being operational.  Photography was mostly not allowed.  I suspect a conspiracy.  Even had I been able to photograph these places though, I would not have gotten good photos.  The temples are dungeons inside except for where the idols of the gods are, and the palaces are not well lit either.  Tipu's palace was unlit, except for some crappy displays of 300-year-old guns and assorted military paraphernalia, most of it British.

The one thing I didn't do was the botanic gardens.  I'm sure they're cool and all.  Because I was by myself, I kinda zoomed thru all the other things to see, and was done with them by 3:30pm.  The botanic gardens have some fountains that they light up, and those turn on at 7pm.  I wasn't up for waiting around for 3 hours trying to amuse myself somehow, so I went back to the hotel.
