I put on a little weight over the holidays.  The stresses of being jobless and all that.  So some shirts that I bought to look good for work no longer fit me.  Or, don't fit me well enough, in most cases.  I can wear them, and look okay in them so long as I don't sit down.  I'm working on loosing that weight, but such things are not easy or quick, despite what anyone might promise you.

So today I went in to The City to buy some shirts that do fit me.  Barney's is lately my favorite stop.  Because it is "upper crust", the staff is willing to help, and actually knows a thing or two about the stuff they sell.  Barney's is also just down the block from the second subway stop in Manhattan on the N line, so it is easy to get in and out of.

I made it in, and almost made it out.  Today in NYC was gorgeous spring weather.  I walked right past the subway station, and into <a href="http://www.centralparknyc.org/">Central Park</a>.

I started at <a href="http://www.centralparknyc.org/virtualpark/southend/pond/">the Pond</a> and watched the ducks.  The Pond is quiet, and you can hear the splash of water a duck makes when taking off or landing in water.  Then I walked to <a href="http://www.centralparknyc.org/virtualpark/southend/wollmanrink/">Wollman Rink</a>, and watched the ice skaters.  Then past the <a href="http://www.centralparknyc.org/virtualpark/southend/dairy/">Dairy</a>, kind of around to the west a little, and then out to 7th Ave.

From there, I walked down to the Carnegie Deli, and had a pistol (pastrami on rye).  Then I came home and had a nap.

One of the more pleasant days I've had in a while, even if it was pretty brief.  And all done without seeing a single protester of any kind.
