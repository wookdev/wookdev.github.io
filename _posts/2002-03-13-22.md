I have to say, Ben &amp; Jerry's, Wavy Gravy is the perfect ice cream. Its
only competition is Hagen Daaz, Belgian Chocolate. I've never seen that flavor
of Hagen Daaz in New York anywhere, only in London. So, I eat Wavy Gravy here.

Imagine this: It is raining in New York city. Wook decides he's going to work
from home today, to avoid going out in the rain. Then the e-mail comes: Can
you comment on this trouble ticket opened by Test on this spec you wrote last
year?

Noooooooo. Not without going out in the rain to the office.

I put on my weather resistant ski jacket to avoid rain water actually touching
me so I wouldn't melt, and out I went.

Yeah, I know: Boo Hoo.

I guess the point of this is that it was raining, and really gloomy, today
in NYC.

[New York City's water supply][nyc water supply] is [only half full][reservoir levels].
Unless we get rain of biblical proportions soon, we will be in
water conservation mode. Ironic that this was announced on a gloomy, rainy,
day.

The link to the [NYC water supply][] is actually half interesting. Check it out.

Going to have to retrain myself to hear the new cell phone's ring as coming
from My Phone. My Phone, the old StarTac, never sounded like this.

Life is just tough all over.
