My iPhone 4S is still going strong, tho it could probably use a new battery. I'll
probably be buying an iPhone 6, probably the small one, because I want an iPhone with
the motion co-processor. I use location services enough that I have it on all the
time, and GPS just sucks the life out of the battery on an iPhone 4S. The M8 chip's
primary purpose is not to provide GPS tracking, it is to provide GPS with a minimal
power drain. The iPhone 5 has this too, but I couldn't justify upgrading that soon
after I got my 4S.

I went from the iPhone 3G to the iPhone 4S, which is a 3
model upgrade (3G, 3Gs, 4, 4S). From the 4S to the 6 is also three models. My contract
is way past time where I can get a new phone.

Really, the only decision to make
on getting a new phone is not "should I", but "what carrier to get".

AT&amp;T
sucks pretty much anywhere. But at the same time, they also mostly work almost
everywhere. The only place I can get all 5 bars of service anywhere near me is
in movie theaters. I almost get 1 bar at home. Sometimes.

Verizon has good
service all over. But not on Cape Cod at my friend's house there, so they aren't
infallible. The main problem with Verizon is that they are just pure evil. I had a
Motorola Razor phone on Verizon, and the internet landing page that asked if you were
sure you wanted to go the internet because you'd be charged for it, was ON THE
INTERNET AND YOU WERE ALREADY BEING CHARGED FOR IT. Verizon started the
bullshit of always announcing how to use voice mail because it makes everyone use
extra airtime listening to it.

Sprint's coverage is good in some areas.
Not so good in others. They appear to have the most data for the least money.

T-Mobile isn't an option.

I don't know that I'm ready to get an unlocked iPhone
6 and take it to a small [MVNO][] that uses AT&amp;T or Verizon's networks. The phone
is not cheap when not subsidized, I doubt the money saved by going small would offset
the up-front cost of the unlocked phone.
