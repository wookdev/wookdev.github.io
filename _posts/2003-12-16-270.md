I was sitting in bed this morning, waking up.  Out of the blue, I opened the drawer in the nightstand, pulled out the alarm clock, and set it.  I have no idea where this sudden knowledge on the clock's whereabouts came from.

Packed for Pittsburg tonight.  This involved finding things deeply buried.  Toiletry kit.  Travel charger for the phone.  I found the travel charger for the iPod, but I still haven't come across the iPod itself.  I found two whole second sets of toiletries once I started looking for them.   Most of the shampoo and conditioners where nearly empty though.  Bummer.  I have an astounding number of tubes of toothpaste now though.

Boris hasn't fixed the stove.  Not that I use it a lot, but it is nice to know that it is there if I need it.

Plugged the cable modem in, just on the off chance it might work.  It didn't.
