Saturday I slept in, which felt wonderful.

After getting moving, I met up with The Crew at <a href="http://www.caesars.com/Paris/LasVegas/Dining/FineDining/MonAmiGabi.htm">Mon Ami Gabi</a>, which is the sidewalk cafe at <a href="http://www.caesars.com/paris/lasvegas/">Paris</a>.  Dave and Marc seem to like to sit outdoors by the sidewalk, and watch the crowd go by.  There were 10 of us, so we had to sit at 2 tables.  Eating outside is nice, but not when it is so windy your drink keeps getting blown over.  One table of us moved inside, the other didn't seem to have a problem.

The plan was to see our respective shows, and then meet for dinner at Emeril's.  I've seen the Broadway version of <a href="http://www.avenueq.com/">Avenue Q</a> very recently, and I really wanted to see <a href="http://www.henryrollins.com">Henry Rollins</a> talking show in person once, and he was only playing once at House of Blues in Mandalay Bay.  So I sold my ticket to <a href="http://www.avenueq.com/">Avenue Q</a> to Hilly, and went to see <a href="http://www.henryrollins.com">Henry</a>.

I should have asked how long <a href="http://www.henryrollins.com">Mr. Rollins</a> would talk, turned out to be two and a half hours, which meant my 7:30 show lasted until 10:00, an hour later than the reservation for dinner.  I got there just as they were closing.

Emeril's does a really nice surf and turf.  It was very yummy.

After dinner, we went to <a href="http://www.ogvegas.com/">Olympic Gardens</a>, a large strip club kind of at the far end of the strip.  It is one of the classier places, supposedly, but I found it to be just an uncomfortable, badly-maintained, place with naked women in it shaking down desperate, frustrated, chumps for far more money than the whole experience is really worth.

The draw of the <a href="http://www.ogvegas.com/">Olympic Gardens</a> is that it has male strippers upstairs, dancing for the women.  Dave, Haley, Hilly (who is also Dave, btw), Chris, Mike, and Sue, all went upstairs.  But I didn't really have anyone to impress by staying up there, and I long since got tired of being at strip clubs to watch other patrons react.  So I hung out downstairs.  They had a great time upstairs.  I'm surprised they stayed downstairs once they realized the female strippers were mostly second string.  This is not a busy time of year for the strip clubs, it seems.

Surprise, surprise, I had a great time.  I wasn't expecting to.  I ended up attracting strippers, who would sit and talk.  I fell in love (briefly) with one stripper that turned out to be a total geek.  I knew this when she told me her name was (I think) "Shara, which means leprosy in Hebrew".  She had earlier told me she "was a trouper".  Not a normal M.O. for a stripper.  She was also into The Sims, World of Warcraft, and assorted Anime.

After <a href="http://www.ogvegas.com/">Olympic Gardens</a> we played some more craps, then turned in for the night at like 3 AM.
