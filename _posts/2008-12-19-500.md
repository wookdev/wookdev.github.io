So it's snowing here in NYC. Upstate and places without a massive heat column
are supposed to get dumped on big time.  We're just supposed to get 8 to 10 inches
I think.

This is actually the third snow we've gotten, but the first one that will amount
to something.  I missed the first when it happened.  Second was Tuesday (3 days ago).
This won't stick around either, the streets are still to warm for snow to last long.
But this snow will probably cool them down enough to that any future snow storms
will probably dump snow that will last for a while.

I like snow, and winter in general.  I'd have posted this anyway, but this post
is also a test of putting more photos up on this site.  The photo above was taken
with my iPhone, and uploaded with SmugShot, an iPhone app that seems damn cool.
