On Wednesday I looked up at the window over my desk, and there was a wasp flying around
against the blinds. It took me a while of following it around, but I killed it with a
fly-swatter in the kitchen.

Today (Friday) as I was getting a glass of water at the kitchen sink, I saw a wasp
shaped shadow on the curtains over the sink. I killed that one with the fly-swatter
too, and then a second one flew out at me. After following it around the kitchen for
a couple of minutes, I managed to kill it as well.

That's three in two days. Gonna have to look at the house, to see if I can figure out
what's going on. Off the top of my head, I'm guessing they are either coming in thru
the range hood vent, or thru the badly-hung back door. Or the fireplace. Never used
it, so never even think of it.

Guess I'll let the landlord know tomorrow too.
