A nice, upper-end hotel.  They do not "get it", and are not worth the money it costs to stay here.  I would give it 2 stars out of 5 based on my desires and peeves.

They get points for being a nice hotel, having room service, a concierge, and the rooms are large and nice.  It has high-end beds with a pillow-top mattress pad.  There is a working thermostat in the room, and the HVAC unit blows hot and cold.  The TV picture and sound quality is good on all channels.

They loose points for a few pet peeves: They do not use fitted sheets on the bed.  The flat sheet that is on the bottom isn't large enough to tuck in securely.   So it pulled out a couple of times last night and I had to keep getting up to tuck it back in.  This is kind of an expensive hotel to not be able to afford to spend the money on fitted sheets and/or the time for the housekeeping staff to actually put them on the beds.

The shower head is a little on the low side, and the pressure isn't great.  The hot water is only warm, but seems to be warm enough.  The bathroom itself it only as large as it needs to be, and it slightly claustrophobic.

I did not get around to testing the hotel wifi internet with games to see how it stacks up.
