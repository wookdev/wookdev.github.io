I once read that deleting your FB profile was the adult way of running away from home.
I guess I've run away from home, because I deleted my Facebook account.  I love my
friends and family and all, but I just haven't been seeing value in FB.

It might turn out that there's some value there I'll miss.  But I don't think so, and
I won't know until I have no access any more and miss it somehow.

Facebook kind of killed my blogging habbit, way back when.  I don't know that I think I'll
pick it up again.  But I do know that it isn't going to happen while FB was easier to post
on.

And finally, as someone who is concerned about personal privacy, I can now block all FB
cookies and scripts on all of FB's domains across the board.  Instead of worrying about
having to keep some sort of minimal set so the actual FB site would work.  I don't
really view this as a way of actually being completely untracked, because there
are almost as many ways of tracking people across the net as there are tracking companies
on the net.  No, it's mostly just a raised middle finger to FB and their tracking efforts.
