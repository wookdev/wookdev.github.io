Drove to Minneapolis today to pick up Charles so he can attend the party this
weekend. Managed to get on the road at 11:30, after changing cars with Hertz
at the airport. Got to Charles's place in Minneapolis just after 3:00, just
minutes after he got home. We were headed South again before 3:30, and got to
the party just after 7:30.

I'm totally positive that Iowa changed their rural interstate highway speed
limit to 70 at some point, and that now they've set it back down to 65. Completely
positive. This bums be out, since I like to drive.
