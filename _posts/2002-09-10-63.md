Home late. Flight left late, got in later.

Highlights of the trip:

Training on the IWS. Very cool little device.

Got to spend an hour with Marc. Saw his new TV.

Left my passport and airline tickets at the hotel, but didn't realize until
I was standing outside the airport. Had them couriered from the hotel to the
airport. Made my flight by just minutes. Will have to suffer the story told
every now and then for the rest of my life.

Bed now. Big day tomorrow.
