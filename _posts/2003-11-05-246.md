While poking around for the <a href="/2003/11/05/2003-11-05-245">Matrix Revolutions story</a>, I ran across this article on the BBC News site: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3242607.stm" title="Titanic Sinks In Worst Film Poll">Titanic Sinks In Worst Film Poll</a>.  A poll has named Titanic, the biggest box office hit to date and winner of 11 Oscars, the worst film ever.

Favorite quote: "It sank. There. I've saved you three hours of hour life." I couldn't agree more, though I might not put in in the top 10.  Much as I hated it, there are pleanty of worse films out there.
