While poking around for the [Matrix Revolutions story][], I ran across this article
on the BBC News site: [Titanic Sinks In Worst Film Poll][].
A poll has named Titanic, the biggest box office hit to date and winner of 11 Oscars,
the worst film ever.

Favorite quote: "It sank. There. I've saved you three hours of hour life." I
couldn't agree more, though I might not put in in the top 10.  Much as I hated it,
there are pleanty of worse films out there.
