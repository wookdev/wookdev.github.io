Most of this is taken from a The Register piece titled "Are the ice caps melting", with
the amusing subtitle of "Climate science's bipolar disorder".  I'm just extracting the
links and info to keep them around. However, if you are interested, the answer is that
no, the ice cap is not melting any more than it normally does, and in fact is going to
be bigger in 2008 than it was in 2007.  And to take it a step further, it has melted
before.  The northwest passage, which so many claim has never opened in recorded
history, has in fact been sailed roughly 110 times since 1905. Submarines have come
to the surface at the north pole in cracks between ice floes and otherwise open water
in 1987, and again in 2000 and 2005.
