See smattering of new humor in <a href="/rofl/index.html">ROFL</a>. Stuff
off my hard drive. Some of it collected more than 5 years ago.

Got a new camera today.

Film.

Analogue.

I'm not sure about film. The instant gratification of digital is pretty alluring.
Point, shoot, show, all in minutes. But, I do still own the old Nikon 990, and
can use it when it makes sense. And if it turns out that I'm spending A Whole
Bunch on developing film, then it might make sense to get one of the digital
SLR cameras.

Until then... film.

At least, when I get batteries and buy some film. Then I'll be in business.
