[Google Fiber][] is [coming to the Triangle][]. The pattern here, once Google has
made its announcement, has followed the pattern [elsewhere][].  The first thing that
happens right after the announcement is that AT&T announces they're going to roll
out U-Verse Gigapower fiber service, or [cut it's price significantly][].  The second is
that the cable companies [bump the speeds up as much as possible][].  AT&T did it in
Kansas City and Austin, Comcast and Time Warner Cable have done it too.

It is amazing what a little competition will do.  And now it has happened here.

In response to Google fiber coming to The Triangle, TWC changed all their internet
plans such
that the "ultimate" plan, that used to be 50Mbps, is now 300Mbps. I had the Ultimate
plan, and had 50Mbps internet.  Now I have 300Mbps.

When they changed
my speed, I started having internet issues. The facebook web page wouldn't always
completely load, getting stuck with empty elements or fail to load more posts as I
scrolled down.  Twitter had similar problems. I'd get SSL errors, and websites not
found.  Streaming video wouldn't load on the first
try or would take forever to start. Despite having 300Mbps service, speed tests
showed only 120 or so.

Talking to TWC tech support this morning, they did all the standard things, none of
which worked.  But when I
complained about the 120Mbps max speed, they said "Oh, the Surfboard SB6141 is only
rated for 100Mbps, so that's pretty good, really..."  When
I protested that Motorola said
otherwise, the TWC person said that TWC network engineers actually test them,
and the SB6141 is good
for only 100Mbps. There are other Surfboards that are capable of the 300Mbps I'm
signed up for.  They pointed me to the [supported modems list][].

I thanked her for her help, and hung up.

And then called TWC customer support, and downgraded my service to the 100Mbps
tier, which is also $40 cheaper. Downgrading all the way back to 50Mbps was $45
cheaper, and I decided that the extra $5 was worth twice the speed.

And now FB loads reliably in Firefox, which was the web site and browser that
were the most affected before. I scrolled down for 10 minutes and it kept adding
pages at the bottom, which hasn't worked reliably for a month.

My problems may not be totally fixed.  I'm still seeing lots of TCP resets and
retransmissions from Akamai sites.  But I'm kind of suspicious that this is a Firefox
browser problem.  But that's another post...
