My friend Erin is traveling around the country doing research for a book. I
got an email from her today with the following tidbit in it:

> I must warn my lady friends...if you ever find yourself in a bar in MPLS
> [Minneapolis] called the Newsroom, please note that when you are looking at
> your reflection in the ladies room mirror, you are also staring directly into
> the men's bathroom. It's a one-way mirror; you can't see them, but they can
> sure see you!

I'm glad that she's also warned me. I've detailed my friend <a href="http://www.visi.com/%7Ejonskerr/">Jon</a>
to check this out and get back to us. I might have to change my vacation from
the desert Southwest to visiting family in Minneapolis.

Not that I would EVER do anything as sleazy as look through a one-way mirror
into the women's room.

Never!

I also have to wonder how she knows about this. Specifically, what guy squealed?
Come on guys, we have to stick together on this kind of thing! Don't make us
come over there and do something about it.

Also, tonight I was going to have dinner with my friend <a href="http://www.gack.com/">Susan</a>.
But NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Susan and I can't have a meal with each other without spending
about 4 months beforehand trying to get our schedules to match up.

So when I asked her a couple of days ago if she wanted to try out Donguri,
a Japanese place up by where she lives, she agreed, and we decided on Monday
night (tonight) I should have known it could never be this easy. Donguri is
closed on Mondays, it turns out. We talked on the phone well past the time I
should have left to go up to the Upper East Side, about where to eat instead.
But a massive case of the "fuckits" prevailed, and we rescheduled
for tomorrow night.

I have to wonder what fresh new tragedy will occur tomorrow. Hopefully, <a href="http://www.gack.com/">Susan</a>
and I won't cause the place to burn down or anything.

Also, it should be noted that <a href="http://www.gack.com/">Susan</a> demanded
that I put her in this journal. She is kind of pushy that way.

Because of the <a href="/2002/05/21/2002-05-21-128/">flood back in May</a>, I need
to get my apartment painted. And, the aquarium is in the way of that. So it
comes back down for a while longer. Since it isn't actually running yet, anyway.

&lt;sigh&gt;

In my weaker moments, I just think I should give up on having fish. Fortunately,
I'm to lazy to get rid of the tank, so sooner or later, fish will happen. Just
probably not sooner.
