Today I remembered that today is my father's birthday.  I usually remember his birthday every year, but usually I remember it either when I'm not near a phone, or several days later.  This year, I win points because I remembered it on the day itself, and I was sitting at my desk not doing anything else.  So I called him at work, and caught him between classes, and wished him happy birthday.

Dad informed me that this birthday was special.  Before I could ask him if he got a pony, he said this birthday was the last power of 2 he expected to see.  He is 64 years old.  And frankly, that is far cooler than a pony.  I admitted it was cool, and then we both laughed together about how we're both computer nerds.  Then we laughed some more about how I am definitely his son, that I think it's as cool as he does.  We also swapped medical horror stories (I'm having a colonoscopy tomorrow, and dad has had to cancel his due to meds he's taking for his knee).  Then we talked about my mom (she's doing great far as I can tell) and then said our goodbyes.

That is definitely a way cool bonding story. And for your dad, probably as special a birthday as he could have had. Good for you!
