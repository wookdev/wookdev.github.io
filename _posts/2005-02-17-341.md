Oh.... never mind.

<blockquote>
 "How do you do Nothing?" asked Pooh. <br />
"Well, it's when people call out at you just as you're going off to do it, `What are you going to do, Christopher Robin?' and you say, `Oh, nothing' and then you go and do it. It means just going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering."

How lovely to be able to do nothing.  And nobody bothers you about it.

"I'm not going to do Nothing any more." <br />
"Never again?" <br />
"Well, not so much. They don't let you."

Then you grow up.  Or are told that you ought to grow up.

"Oh, bother.  Stuff and fluff!"
