So, I'm going to be doing costume photography for AnimeIowa this year.  This will be the first year I've been to this con, let alone photographing it.  One of the things about this con is the amount of space I'll have to photograph in.  It will be limited.  My current stobes are rather more powerful than I need even for the voluminous room DemiCon gave me.  It would probably blast the windows off the room I'll have for AI.  And, they just aren't adjustable enough for other things I've been doing with them.

So, today, I was bad, but for (I hope) a good reason. I spent money on yet more studio lights.  These ones are much lower power, and are also far more adjustable.  Hopefully, I won't be using ND filters and all sorts of tricks to keep the photos from being overexposed.  I hope.
