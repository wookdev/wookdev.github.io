I'm home.

My suitcase was so over-packed and overweight that Lufthansa charged me nearly $220 bux (INR 8800) to get it on the plane.  I was afraid the first time someone touched it my suitcase would explode and kill like 4 people.  It didn't.  And it made it home.  Customs didn't ask to see in it either, which would have been hard.

I had to be in coach for the BLR to FRA segment, and it sucked for all nine-and-a-half hours.  But somehow I pissed off the guy next to me enough early on that he went to sit with his girlfriend by a window, so I at least got an open seat next to me.  In business class in Frankfurt, the idiot next to me spilled his champagne on me before the doors where even closed.
