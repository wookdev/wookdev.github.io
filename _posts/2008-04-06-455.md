When I moved here to DUMBO, I didn't bring my 20-year-old TV with me.  Several people noted that with-it dudes don't own clapped-out 20-year-old TVs.  Chicks that hang out in bars every night of the week and live in 4 different guy's places own clapped-out 20-year-old TVs that they got from a family member or a boyfriend that they killed and ate somewhere in their past.  With-it dudes own 46" LCD or plasma panels.  So I left the piece of crap behind.

It is therefore with pride, that I announce that I'm going to re-join the mindless millions of couch potatoes.  I used 507,000 American Express membership awards points to secure a SONY Bravia XBR LCD 1080p monitor and stand.  It should arrive in the next 4 weeks.
