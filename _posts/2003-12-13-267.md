Got moved in.

Everything is in piles, or plastic bags at this point.  Movers did an okay job of getting everything back in its room, except where I told them different for whatever reason.  The small bedroom is storage, and actually looks reasonably orderly.  The bed is in the middle bedroom, because is it quieter and has fewer windows.  There are no curtains or blinds on any of the windows.  I have no thumb tacks or nails, so I had to tape a sheet to this window for privacy and darkness in the AM.

Gaffer's tape is a wonderful thing.  Much better than actual duct tape.

The front bedroom, facing the street, is the computer room.  The computer is sitting on the floor in a corner.  There is plenty of time to put it together.  I don't have phone, cable, or internet access yet anyway.

I'm kind of wiped out.  I made the bed, and hooked up the Tivo to the TV, so I could catch up on what has been recorded.  I started watching Battlestar Galactica, but didn't finish it.  I then spent an hour looking for my book, which is coming up to the endgame.  It was on the coffee table, where it was since lunch when I brought it up here.

I celebrated making it thru today by ordering in $50 of sushi. It was yummy.  I even remembered to have it sent to D2, but I'm not sure the door buzzer works.  The delivery guy had to call me to let him in.
