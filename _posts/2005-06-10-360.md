The new computer arrived.

11:45 AM

Realize while reading thru the book for the new machine, that I need an adapter to connect my ADC monitor (Apple Display Connector) to my DVI graphics card.  This adapter is not shipped with the computer, it seems.  A trip to the Apple SoHo store is required.  Thus, lunch plans are made.

At this point, I am unsure just how much data on the old machine I wish to transfer to the new one.  Decisions, decisions.

12:15 PM

On the phone with Apple to figure out what happened to the Firewire 800 cards I ordered and they said were included in this shipment.

12:30 PM

Lunch.  At the Apple Store.

1:30 PM

Return from Apple store with DVI to ADC adapter.  It comes in a box the size and shape of a toaster.  The adapter itself is a little smaller than an Airport Extreme, and looks like an overgrown Airport Express with a power cord attached.  It plugs into power to power the monitor, and takes a USB port on the computer to support the USB ports on the monitor.

Sucks, but until I can justify a 30-inch Cinema Display for myself, this will have to do.

So, what machine did you get?

Not that you're old machine didn't already leave me in the dust.

So what happened to your old machine?  Has it gone to computer heaven? Was it a bad machine and you had to punish it?  Or did it just fry it's little brains out?
