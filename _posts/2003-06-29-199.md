<img src="/pics/ashcroft.jpg" />

I just wanted to have this photo on my site.  This is the picture that John Ashcroft
paid a few thousand dollars to get rid of.  He spent that money (I think) on having
curtains put up in front of this statue that can be closed when press conferences
are held.

If I remember the story behind this picture, Ashcroft was talking about some government
initiative on p0rn, or decency, or some ultra-conservative version of morality, when
this picture was taken.

At least, that is the story I remember.  I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm
wrong, though I reserve the right of every US citizen to remain deluded and wrong,
simply because it is much better story this way.
