I was standing on the Queensboro subway platform today waiting for the 7 train, when I was approached by a dude.  He had a card in his hand, ready to give to me.  He asked me if I was interested in something that sounded like gobbledy gook, and followed it up with "It's the buddhist temple in Manhattan".

I should have taken the info, just to see what the heck buddhism is like, but my New Yorker reflexes had the "Not interested, dude" out before I could even think about it.

Oh well, just something else I won't have tried when I'm dead.
