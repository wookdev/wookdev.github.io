I "cut the cord" on cable TV about 5 years ago, and have not regretted it.
I cut it because Time Warner compresses almost all channels way more than they need to.
Most channels look horrible with video compression artifacts and jitter.
Cable TV wasn't worth the extreme money charged for it.  It was an extra $120 bux I
could do something else with every month too.

But I did miss out on some shows I did watch.  Most of them on HBO.  Bill Maher I
usually enjoyed.  I watched the Sopranos when it was running.  A couple of others.

HBO announced "HBO Now" last month with Apple, and it went live today or yesterday.
I signed up for the free trial, and I can't imagine I won't keep it when I have to
pay for it.

Signing up via the Apple TV didn't work.  But I downloaded the iOS app, and signing
up that way did work.
