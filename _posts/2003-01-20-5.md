There have been updates to the journal since the last major
news item was posted, so I thought I'd just put a kind of "New Year's
Update" up to update people I haven't seen lately. Sorry I haven't
done this before now, but I was in the Midwest on vacation for the last
three weeks, and haven't had access to Dreamweaver.

Firstly, I got laid off from Isomair at the end of last
year. This had nothing to do with with me, or them, and was totally about
the realities of start-up companies. I have no hard feelings, and wish
them success.

There is no news on the job front I can share just yet,
but I should be okay for a while.

As always, check back here, or in the journal for more details.
