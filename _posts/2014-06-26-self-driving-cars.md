Everyone knows that [Google][] and others are working on [cars that drive themselves][]
Some are saying "we'll all be driven around by these things in 2 years".

[Those people are wrong.][nytimes]

Assuming that by some chance, cars can be self-driving in my lifetime, here are
the issue I see and what it would take to get me in such a vehicle:

### Failure Modes

I know the assorted ways I can fail when driving. My attention can wander.
I can be fatigued. I can be looking behind me to change lanes when something
happens in front of me. I could suddenly have a heart attack or some other medical
disaster that takes me out.

Because I understand how these things work, I can do things to make sure they don't
happen. I can avoid using my phone, or looking at the screen in the car too long.
I can make sure I'm rested and not driving while too tired to stay awake. I can
estimate conditions in front of me to know when it is okay to glance back over my
shoulder to check traffic. I move the side mirrors so they show my blind spot
instead of what's behind the car.

Yes, every now and then something bad will
happen, but I've been pretty safe my whole life. Up until last year, my only
accident happened in a driveway, when I backed into a retaining wall. Last year,
I hit a deer that ran out onto the road before I could react. (Twice. Damnit.)
I've been driving for 32 years now, and this failure rate is about average.

But when the car is doing the driving, there are all sorts of failures that can
happen. Mechanical problems. Sensor failures. Obstructed views.
Reaction to a situation that puts the vehicle in other danger.

None of those failures can be predicted. I know when I'm feeling sleepy, or
when I'm not paying attention. But the programming of the vehicle's computer,
and its susceptibility to immanent problems isn't knowable. There is no dashboard
light for "I'm going to fuck up now and kill you." Because the vehicle is
operating in real time, any problems are going to be signaled by bad things happening,
like suddenly driving into the ditch or into a phone pole.

In theory, there would be backup systems. There would also be self-test diagnostics
that would constantly monitor the vehicle for issues that would cause it to be
unreliable. In the event that the vehicle suddenly can't turn the steering to
the right, it would stop and sit there until the "driver" moves the car manually.
If there are controls for doing so.

### Liability

When an accident happens, who's at fault? The person sitting behind the wheel
but not driving? The Automaker? The dealer? The owner? Some third party that is
somehow involved?

If the vehicle fails in some way, and causes an accident faster than a human can
intervene, is the driver at fault? How do we know if the driver could have intervened
in time or not after the fact?

### Attention Span

This is actually probably my biggest issue. Say we do get self-driving cars.
But also say that the laws say that a human must be at the wheel to take over if the car
does something it shouldn't. Or just to handle an edge case the car doesn't know how to
handle. Like merging into busy traffic or making a left turn on a busy street.

If I'm not actually driving the car, my attention will wander. I promise you
this. Maybe I'm not actually reading the paper or taking a nap, but I will be
staring off into space out the side window watching the scenery pass by.
Daydreaming. Counting the cows and horses in the fields we go by. Looking at the pretty
girls on the sidewalk or the park.

If something happens, it is likely it will happen when I'm not prepared to intervene.

How do I stay always prepared to intervene? By driving the damn car all the time.
If I'm not in constant and full control, then I must be a passenger with no
responsibilities.

### Fun

I like driving, always and anywhere, I'm enjoying controlling the car and making it
get to my destination. The only time I don't like driving is when I'm sick or
hurting somehow. But in that case I won't be driving in the first place.

Those who know me know that I drive cross-country for days at a time to get where I
want to be. I don't fly if I can avoid it, even for work. I am often totally
wiped out by these 2 day drives, but I won't stop doing them.

### A Long Way To Go

Currently, self-driving cars don't work well in snow or rain, where visibility is
limited and the lidar systems are blocked. They must be able to see the lane markers
to function, which won't be possible in the Northern states during some or all of
winter. While they can pick out bicyclists and their hand signals, pedestrians are
just cylinders to avoid, not police officers directing traffic. Even assuming they
can pick out a person waving their arms to try to stop traffic, how will they know
who to obey? I how do they know who the police are, and who's just waving at a friend
on the other side of the road? They will need to understand ["social ballet of merging",
and other edge cases][nytimes].

### So What Would It Take?

When will I be willing to let the car drive me around?

I must not have to pay any attention to the operation of the car. If I can't
read a paper or book, use my iPad or a laptop, I won't let the car drive. This
is an either/or criteria: I'm either driving, or I'm not. There is no middle
ground.

Failure modes I'm willing to pass on, so long as there is some sort of
certification/auditing process for both the mechanical and the software. Airplanes
have been flying themselves for a long time, and aren't falling out of the sky like
rain in a thunderstorm. Most airplane accidents happen due to pilot error.
But passenger airplanes are designed and certified in multi-year-long tests and
maintained religiously. Cars must be designed and tested to similarly rigorous
standards.

Cars must also be able to handle even the edge cases and oddball situations.
They must be able to merge with human-driven vehicles without being stranded on the
on-ramp by assholes who won't give you an opening.

I must not have any liability of any kind for the vehicle's actions. So long as I
can show I had the car maintained on schedule by a certified shop, I walk away even
if the car has a problem and kills someone. This also applies to legal actions in
civil court. I don't care where the liability lies, so long as none of it lands on me.

Fun. I guess I use the self-driving car when I am planning on getting shit-faced
at a party or bar. Someplace where the fun of being there is greater than the
fun of getting there and back.
