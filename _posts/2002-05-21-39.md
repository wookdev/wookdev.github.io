Well, the camera takes pictures, anyway. I'll have it with me in DSM. I'll
have to shoot a roll and get it developed there, before the wedding. See how
it works.

Living room is mostly cleaned up from The Flood. Stereo is all still in the
back room, and I've not dared to plug the TV back in yet. I want the power outlet
to dry out real good before I start plugging shit into it. I've taken the cover
off of it to help it dry out. The good news so far is that it hasn't started
a major fire since I turned the power on last night.

I found a suit that mostly still fits me. So I have something to wear at the
wedding on Saturday. If I can find the thingy that goes in my suitcase to carry
suits without turning them into dishrags, that is.

I'm rather odd-shaped these days. Maybe I should get a suit tailored, until
I can get into a more normal shape?

Sinus infection has started to turn ugly. Not going to have time for a doctor
until I hit DSM on Thursday though. Hope I make it.

Off tomorrow for Missouri, and then DSM.
