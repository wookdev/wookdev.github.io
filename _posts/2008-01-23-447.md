It still looks like this:

But it is getting better.  Just not damn fast enough.

There have been times when I didn't think it was.  My friend Mandi the Massage Therapist had to tell me it was getting better around New Year's.  After avoiding it due to swelling the first two massages I had from her, she asked if she could touch it, and then proceeded to work out a giant knot that had been hurting from ankle to knee.

Doc Gordon said two weeks ago that the xrays looked good, but it really takes 8 weeks for a broken ankle like mine to heal.  He'd said 6 to 8 on the previous visit, and when I called him on the full 8 week thing, he said I shouldn't listen to him.  I asked him if it wouldn't just be easier to chop the whole thing off at the knee, but Doc G. said that no, it wouldn't be easier at all.  Oh well.

But Doc Gordon did give me an air cast.  It isn't any easier for me to get around in it.  But at least it's "the next step on my rehabilitation".  For those who don't know, an air cast is a miniature version of the monster pictured above.  Thin plastic shells with gel pads velcro'ed around my ankle, thin enough to fit in my shoe.  I wore it a few days last week.  I wore the whole boot (above) Monday for the flight here to MCI, and again today because my ankle was to swollen to wear the air cast and get it into my shoe.

So, another week or so to go.

Then I start physical therapy of some sort.

What do you do in snow and slush? Put a plastic bag on it?

Plus, since I'm a little late reading this one, is your "week or so" over yet and have you started physical therapy yet?

I just walked around in it.  I wasn't really going out in the crappy weather in NYC, and when I was in the Midwest I'd be driving.  In the rain, it would get a little wet, and it would dry.

I had the doctor visit.  He perscribed physical therapy, but I'm a moron and going on the road one week before I actually start it.  I should have just told work "screw you, I need to do this", but no.
