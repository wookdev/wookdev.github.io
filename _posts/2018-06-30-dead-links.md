I've been looking thru the old posts on this site.

Yeesh.

I suck as an author, and have a certain lack of perspective, sometimes even in the best of times.  Often in the best of times.

But the other thing that struck me, was just how much the internet sucks at keeping itself whole as it ages.  Dead links abound.  This is a problem.

One of the important questions is how long should published content remain published.  Do companies that create content and share it need to feel obligated to keep it available forever?  Should they keep it available at the same URL forever?

This site would certainly benefit from the answer to those two questions being "YES!"  When I moved this site to Github Pages a couple of years ago, I took great pains to make sure that all the posts ended up at the URL that I originally posted them at. [But I did that because I could](saga/129.html "Sometimes..."), and [had the time to put into the effort](/saga/115.html).  Such work costs money for companies who are paying people to do this work.  There is rarely a business benefit to doing this, in an age when most content is discoverable via search engines on demand.

The answer to those two questions isn't automatically "yes" for another reason: content creators have a right to remove their work from circulation.  Same as they have a right to modify their content.

I really wanted to look at some of the content that the dead links here point at.  Moveable Type, back when I used it, had a plugin that would download the pages at a link, but not show it unless the link no longer pointed at something.  There's no way to do that automatically for my current setup.  But I might start archiving some of the content behind the links I post.  Or maybe the Internet Archive might help.

Gotta think about this.
