Well, I'm home.  I have a bathroom complete with walls, tile, and a new sink.  The living room has been plastered though not sanded, and painted.  The living room looks better than it ever has.  The bathroom looks worse than it ever did, except that now it is in better shape than it ever was.

Boris replaced the lights in the bathroom with two 100 watt bulbs, which in a completely white, very small room, is kinda on the brutal side for those late night visits, or early showers.  But whatever.

I'd post pictures, but I think they got deleted by accident.
