Okay. The deal is done. The near future is set.

On September 9th, I will start with <a href="http://www.isomair.com/">Isomair
Inc</a>. Isomair does wireless network security. A fairly new field.

In celebration of the deal being done today, I went out
and purchased a bunch of wireless networking stuff. So, if for some reason
I'm not out shooting photos of assorted stuff all weekend, I now have
something else to keep me busy.
