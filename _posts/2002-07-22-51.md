So anyway, the conversation goes like this:

Hertz: Mileage?

> Hertz: Gas?

> Me: No, that's okay, I put 4300 miles on the car.

To be exact, I put 4383 miles on that car in two weeks of driving. How do you
do this? Easy. Drive from Washington DC, almost all the way to New York City
but turn around 100 miles away, drive to Denver Colorado, then back to New York
City. I wouldn't recommend you do this with just any old rental. Mostly because
most of them suck. But I had a Lincoln LS, which is a nice driving car. Comfy
seats, nice sound, and long legs.

Is it cheaper than flying? Maybe, maybe not. Depends on the airfares you get.
This trip was cheaper for me. If I had managed to get a better airfare to Denver,
it wouldn't have.

I saw Dave and Haley while in Chicago for the 4th. And my mother.

Mom has pictures of her European trip, which I'll put up here as soon as I
can. Figuring out how to get her descriptions on the site will be interesting.
