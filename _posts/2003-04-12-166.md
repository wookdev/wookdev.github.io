After a very long week, I've ended up doing nothing this weekend.  I put in a DVD, but ended up walking away from it, unable to get into it.  Instead, I'm scanning a bunch of photos.

HP finally has an OS X scanner driver for my Scanjet 5470c.  It was only 178 Megabytes in size for the download.  I learned that Camino's downloader isn't capable of doing something that large.  It kept dying at around 33 meg.  I suspect there is some limit, since that is close enough to a mystical number to be suspicious.  Mozilla handled it just fine on the first try though.
