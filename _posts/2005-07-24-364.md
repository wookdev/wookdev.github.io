I need a "buddy icon" that is "me".  These things are usually small, 48x48 pixels is a common size.  I suppose it could be a photo of me, but I'd rather it by stylized, or drawn.

Up until now, I usually try to use an Invader Zim icon.  And while it is cool because I'm one of like 5 people who liked Invader Zim, I lost the exact icon I was using, and can't find it any more.

So here is the call: If any of my friends out there who are artistic want to noodle around and come up with anything, I'd love to see it.  I had thought at one point about a simple grey sphere, with glasses, a beard, and pony tail like I wear.  But I'm open to suggestions.
