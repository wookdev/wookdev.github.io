Linked today on Slashdot, <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B954AA053-F953-43F3-BBC8-63D351A3BF2A%7D&siteid=google&dist=google" title="The 10 most overpaid jobs in the U.S.">this article</a> on <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/" title="CBS Marketwatch | The story behind the numbers">CBS Marketwatch</a>, details the 10 most overpaid professions in the U.S. today.  A lot of the 10 are what you'd expect: CEOs, mutual fund managers, pilots, longshoremen, high-end real estate agents.  There are a couple of surprises: airport skycaps being one.

The one I thought was interesting was "Wedding Photographer".  Most get an astonishing amount of money, can do two weddings a weekend, and are mostly mediocre.  So I guess my photography habit could be profitable after all, if I am willing to deal with shrieking mother-in-laws-to-be, and high-strung brides and grooms.

I think I'll pass on this opportunity, for now.
