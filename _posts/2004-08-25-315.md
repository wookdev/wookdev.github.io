The <a href="http://www.wookphoto.com/DemiCon/DemiCon-15">DemiCon 15 photos</a> are finally up.

Along the line, the template for the gallery got screwed up, so the photo pages are a little ugly at the moment, but that can be fixed.  The photos themselves are as done as they will get.

Currently, only the Hall costume and masquerade photos are on Shutterfly.  If there is demand for it, I can put all of the photos up there, for people to make prints from.

Les, your CD will be in the mail as soon as I figure out why my CD burner won't burn a CD that can be read.
