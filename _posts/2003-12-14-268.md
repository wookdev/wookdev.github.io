Finished watching Battlestar Galactica on Tivo.  Hooked the stereo up today too, though not to the Tivo or TV yet.  It can't stay where it is, though in this living room, it might be the only choice.

The whole place is dusty, and gritty.  Probably from the work that was done, and from dust tracked/carried up from downstairs.  I swiffer'ed the whole place.  This caused me to pay attention to the beautiful hardwood floors, which is bubbling and hasn't been sanded smooth.  I guess wall-to-wall carpet is still in the plan.

Oh, and even though the super took out 2 of the 5 radiators in the apartment, it is still really warm in here.  I've turned off the radiator in the office and have a window open in the back back bedroom and the dining room.

None of the doors in here close, let alone latch.  Need to threaten Boris and get him back up here to scrape the paint out of the hinges, and fix the strike plates this week.

The tub in the back bathroom, the one I'm planning on using daily, is plugged beyond my ability to clear.  Probably full of plaster.

I spent 90 minutes looking for my alarm clock, so I can make it into work on time.  Never found it.  Going to use my cell phone, which I've done before.
