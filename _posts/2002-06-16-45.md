Well I feel I should put an update here. It has been a while since I last did.
But I'm pretty wiped out. To much travel, to many time zones.

Also, I got a paper cut under a fingernail today. Up until now, it has been
bothering me a little. Now, when I'm typing, it hurts like hell. So, Wookie
no type much tonight.

Purchased a new air-conditioner this weekend. A new unit to take the place
of the old one in the living room. Next weekend, it gets delivered and installed.
I also want to get a chiller for the aquarium, since it is possible that the
apartment will be Very Warm for long periods of time. Tropical fish like warm
water, but not 90+ degree water.
