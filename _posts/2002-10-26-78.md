...and now, Out-Of-Context Theater brings you:

I was re-reading Susan's last email to me, and this sentence popped out at
me:

> "...the last word is that I am indeed pushy and cruel." 

So, not only is she pushy and cruel, but it would seem she's a mite arrogant
as well. This brings the total to 3 major character flaws so far.

Gerry is now punishing me for everything I've said about her by pointing out
every stupid mistake she can find. Thus, making me feel like a moron. Thankfully,
I know I'm a moron, so it isn't going to work. She does seem to be enjoying
it though. I guess paybacks really are fun.
