I'm in Des Moines, Iowa today, where I grew up, for my step-mother's 60th surprise birthday party. I landed last night, and fly home tomorrow.  We had the party, which my stop-mother knew about already, tonight.  I got to meet and talk to some of my parents friends, talk to my brothers and sisters.  My sisters Erin and Emily are both pregnant, Emily newly-so.  My brother has just moved into a new house, and walk talking about it.  My sister Andree was in town with her boyfriend, she'll be staying a couple of days.  For my part, I just tried to be as annoying as possible taking photos, and talking to everyone.

A good time was has by all.
