There are two reasons not to wear Levi's Button-Fly, 501 Jeans on a flight these days.

The first would be because shrink-to-fit jeans from back before baggy was good, are a little restricitve.  "Restrictive" is the last word you want to use to describe anything you happen to be wearing, and a seat you have no choice but to sit in for a few hours.

The second reason would be because the metal in the rivets, and buttons, sets off the metal detectors at the airport all by themselves, and THEN you get the most personal pat-down you can get with all your clothes still on.

Just a word of warning
