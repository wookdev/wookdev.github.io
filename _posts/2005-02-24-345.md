The only funny part about <a href="http://www.apostrophe.fsnet.co.uk/" title="Apostrophe Protection Society">this site</a> is its name.  And its name isn't especially funny, really.

Sorry if you looked at it expecting to see something about Frank Zappa.  I just wanted to post this to keep the link around.
