My opinion of [Al Gore][] has flip-flopped back and forth over the years. I mostly
blame the media for this. Journalists for some reason are never kind to vice
presidents, and so I pick that opinion up for myself. In years since, he is portrayed
as a bunch of things, but of course the media picks the most sensational stuff, and
so I sometimes have believed him to be a nut-job of the highest order.

I realize that I am human, and when I hear enough about something or someone in the
media, I'll tend to pick up whatever slant is presented most often. It is a fact of
our psychology, and it is hard to avoid.

My current opinion of Al Gore, is mostly that I'm sick and tired of Al Gore.

When I came across an interview, I decided to watch, to hear something about Al Gore
that didn't come filtered thru the media. This is Al Gore in the words of Al Gore.

It is an interesting interview, and I'm really glad I watched. The interview only
briefly touches on climate issues. The rest of it was really fascinating.

Things I liked:

1. "Information Superhighway": He didn't invent the internet, but he did coin the phrase.
1. His relationship with Steve Jobs, being on Apple and Google boards.
1. His discussion about how our democracy has been "hacked" into not functioning
as the founding fathers intended.
1. Edward Snowden: Not a hero, broke the laws, but did us a huge service in exposing
constitutional violations that probably make the NSA <strong>less</strong> effective
in doing its job.

It is long, but I enjoyed the whole thing. Watch it here:
