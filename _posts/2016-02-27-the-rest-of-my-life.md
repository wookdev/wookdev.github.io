I've been "on a diet" now for about 8 years.  I've lost zero pounds in
that time.

In fact, I've gained maybe 70 pounds since around the turn of the century,
and I was already 60 pounds overweight then.  In fact, with one exception, I
have always been the heaviest I've ever been.  Gaining weight year after
year.

The exception: I lost 25
pounds in 4 months in 2011.  I was walking 4 miles across the Brooklyn
Bridge and back
five nights a week.  It had little to do with the food I was eating.  I was
eating nachos and loaded tater tots for lunch and [3 scoops of ice cream][] afterwards most weekdays, and sometimes twice on Saturdays and Sundays.  But
I was walking 15 to 25 miles a week, and losing weight.

Then I broke my foot, and the walking ended.  About the time I could walk on
it again I moved away from the
bridge.  I gained back the 25 pounds over the next year, and more since.

I did learn tho, that you don't have to diet to lose weight. Walking is often
called the best exercise you can get, and I'd have to agree.  Four months of
walking across the bridge also improved my core strength.  I was able to do
pilates moves that my trainer never would have thought to ask me to try
prior to that.

I moved away from the Brooklyn bridge at the end of 2011, and it was probably
the worse thing I had ever done for my health, ever.  While walking across the
Bridge was annoying, the annoyance factor kept me engaged and it was rarely
boring.  I was engaged in the process of
getting across the bridge without getting killed by bicyclists or trapped by
tourists asking me to take 1000 photos of them in front of every conceivable
part of the skyline.

I've tried to get in the walking habit again here.  It's boring.  City
streets just don't have any stimulation, no engagement.  Interesting places
to walk are a drive away, and if I can't just go out and do it, I typically
don't.  I've tried walking on treadmills, but couldn't keep at that either.
I started walking across the bridge when I realized I'd given up on the
treadmill twice, soon to be three times.

So here, where I live now, with no Brooklyn Bridge to make the walk happen,
weight loss has to be via diet.

I usually described the diet I claimed I was on
as "like the paleo diet, but not exactly the paleo diet".  But I wasn't really
doing the paleo diet.  Or any diet at all.  I ate what I wanted, when I wanted
it, as much as I wanted.  Ben & Jerry's.  Haagen Dazs.  Cheese on everything.
Sandwiches a staple of almost everything I ate.  Huge portions.  I never felt
hungry, never stopped.

My weight continued to increase.  Last year, I swore to myself that I would
not let my weight go above 350 pounds.  I made no changes.  Monday morning
after Christmas last year the number on the scale was 354.

I might have freaked out.  Just a little bit.

I had to change.  I had to loose 150 pounds or so.  The morbid joke in my
head was "...or die trying."  I realized that I had to reduce my
weight or I'd die early. Everyone dies, there is no cheating death, it comes
for everyone.  I've always been dismissive of people that were hyper-obsessed
with everything healthy to the point of being almost OCD, as if somehow, you
could get out of life alive.  But I decided I wanted to fit in a narrow casket.

I made a [Facebook post][] to my friends on January 1st, 2016:

> Okay. Time to look forward now. A new year, a new plan, a new goal. My goal

> This is my wanting to lose 150 pounds for the rest of my life. Might take

My plan is simple: No eating crap.

Humans are omnivores, designed to
eat meat and vegetables, and fruits when they were available.  So that's my
diet now.  No sugar, grains,
dairy, legumes, and only limited fruit.  After almost two months of this, I can
say it
isn't an easy diet. There are only so many types of meat, and only so many
types of vegetables.  It requires imagination.  Fortunately I have simple
tastes in food, so the imagination I've needed has mostly been something I've
been capable of.  It helped that Ally has taken this cause up for herself.

So far tho, it's been working.  Quite nicely too.

I do "fall off the wagon" at times.  I still love lasagne and cheeseburgers.
Eating out is really hard because even simple dishes often come with proscribed
sides, or are cooked in ways that include proscribed ingredients.  I eat
what I want, tho I try to stay towards things that are simple.
