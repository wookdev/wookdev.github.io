I'm sitting here at a cusomter site out in the wilds of New Jersey, when the lights flickered.  Then they flickered again.  The HVAC blowers stopped, then the lights flickered again, then the blowers started back up. We lost connectivity to the outside world, because the network switches in the closet were all resetting.

We thought it was an air conditioner problem.

Turns out it is a little larger problem than just the air conditioning at an AT&T facility causing a brown-out.  The whole eastern seaboard is out of power.  CNN says it goes all the way out to Detroit and Toronto, Canada.

Reports from people in NYC say that the subways are dead.  The Long Island Railroad is stopped.  Makes me wonder about Metro North, the commuter rail I'd be on in half an hour if I had been in White Plains today.

Me, I'm fine, in case you were wondering.  I'm not even going home tonight, even though I'm just an hour or so away.  We expect that the power here in NJ might be out, but we expect it to be on soon.  Hopefully, since the hotel would be unpleasant without air conditioning.

This is mostly just to let everyone know that I'm affected, but not at home, or even trying to get home tonight.
