I can assign categories to posts. Problem is, I'd rather have one set of
categories, and use them forever more, with the occational addition as new things
come up.

Or, I'd rather have a small set where each is broad enough that
I won't ever need any new ones.

Or....

Sigh. Crap.

There are like 4 posts on this blog, and already I am running into things
that should only bother me when I realize I have 200+ posts in the category
"Opinion" and another couple hundred in "Pontification". Both categories
being the same thing in my mind.

This is partially a case of having a feature and being determined to use
it no matter how useful it is. As a tech support goon, I see the
CONSTANTLY in other people. You'd think after seeing the evil it
causes, I'd be imune. But I like my toys too, which is basically
what a feature is.

So, ideas.

* "Show", "Tell"
* "YMMV", "IANAL", "ROFL", "OMW", "IIRC", etc
* "&lt;A&gt;", "&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;", "&lt;LI&gt;", etc
* "Car", "Life", "Event", "Opinion", "Site"

Right now, as I write this, I'm leaning towards the internet slang abreviations.
Damn [Brett Glass][] for taking [ymmv.com][] back in the 90's and not updating the
content on it in over 16 years. That's just mean.
