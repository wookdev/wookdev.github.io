I can assign categories to posts.  Problem is, I'd rather have one set of categories,
and use them forever more, with the occational addition as new things come up.

Or, I'd rather have a small set where each is broad enough that I won't ever need
any new ones.

Or....

Sigh.  Crap.

There are like 4 posts on this blog, and already I am running into things that should
only bother me when I realize I have 200+ posts in the category "Opinion" and another
couple hundred in "Pontification".  Both categories being the same thing in my mind.

This is partially a case of having a feature and being determined to use it no matter
how useful it is.  As a tech support goon, I see the CONSTANTLY in other people.  You'd
think after seeing the evil it causes, I'd be imune.  But I like my toys too, which is
basically what a feature is.

So, ideas.

*    "Show", "Tell"
*    "YMMV", "IANAL", "ROFL", "OMW", "IIRC", etc
*    "Car", "Life", "Event", "Opinion", "Site", etc

Right now, as I write this, I'm leaning towards the internet slang abreviations.
Damn [Brett Glass](http://www.brettglass.com/) for taking
[ymmv.com](http://www.ymmv.com) back in the 90's and not updating the content
on it in over 16 years.  That's just mean.
