Sick today. Stomach troubles. Not sure why.

I'm getting caught up on TV shows I haven't watched yet, but that are sitting
on the TiVo. Got through two back episodes of ER. Course, I had to watch one
of them twice, because I fell asleep halfway through. Going to attack the Firefly
episodes tomorrow. Oh, and got through two Sopranos as well.

I'm trying to decide if my couch is actually comfortable to sit on, or if it
is deceptively uncomfortable.

I keep looking at the fish tank. I STILL haven't taken it down, so it sits
there pumping water through a filter that isn't supporting any fish. Something
wrong with this picture. But i still can't take it down. Maybe I should just
go get a damn fish, something cheap, and put it in there for a week or two.
Just so I can say it HAD fish in it, and I can take it down.
