The description from <a href="http://eepybird.com" title="EepyBird.com">the web site</a> of this video:

> What happens when you combine 200 liters of Diet Coke and over 500 Mentos mints? It's
> amazing and completely insane.  The first part of this video demonstrates a simple
> geyser, and the second part shows just how extreme it can get. Over one hundred jets
> of soda fly into the air in less than three minutes. It's a hysterical and spectacular
> mint-powered version of the Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas, brought to you by the
> mad scientists at EepyBird.com.
