For those who are waiting patiently, or not so patiently, for me to finish the DemiCon pictures up, and get them up on the web, I offer this status update:

Soon...  So very, very, soon...

How soon, you might ask?

The hall costumes and masquerade costumes are all done, and have been uploaded to the photo service I'll be using for prints.  I've ordered a set of prints, and when they arrive, and if they look good, I'll post the URL and send the info to DMSFS for posting on their web sites, and for the Paradox.

I expect that to happen by the weekend.

The web site is another story.  I use Apple's iPhoto to pull in the photos, arrange them, and then use the BetterHTMLExport plug-in to actually crank out the web gallery pages and pictures.  But for whatever reason, I'm not happy with the way they look.  To much compression or something.  So I'm going to have to fall back to other tools I was thinking of switching to anyway.  So the web site will have to wait a week or two, until I'm done with some pressing work at work.

So, fear not.  The photos from DemiCon 14 are NOT lost in some black hole never to be seen again.  They shall live to see the light of day, and be light captured on paper or computer screens
