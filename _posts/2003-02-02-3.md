There is a certain kind of hero, that goes to work every morning to a job that is
dangerous. Astronauts are just such a job. Astronauts risk death every time they go
into space, for no reason other than it is worth doing so.

Yesterday, the shuttle Columbia broke up over Texas on its way to a landing in
Florida. My sympathies go to the families of Rick Husband, Willy McCool, Kalpana
Chawla, Michael Anderson, Laurel Clark, David Brown, and Ilan Ramon.
