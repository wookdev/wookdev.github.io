What a day.

First, let me just say that TV is now TiVo. TiVo is Very Cool. And I already
can't live without it. I watched 3 hours of TV tonight, and none of it was anything
broadcast during the time I spent watching it. Last night, I spent a half hour
making dinner, and then backed ER back up to the beginning so I could see the
whole thing, and then I could fast forward through all the commercials.

Damn cool. This thing is what VCRs are supposed to be. But a VCR is not even
close to being this easy to use.

Work was interesting. Nothing interesting enough to put here. But interesting.

I'd forgotten how much I like Brooklyn Brewery's "East India Pale Ale".
Tasty stuff.

Tomorrow's task is to get the DVD and CD players in to be looked at. I also
need to buy new luggage, since the big Tumi has more or less fallen apart. Or
at least, all the handles have fallen off. I wanted to so some photography too.
Have to see about that.
