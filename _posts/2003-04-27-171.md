Saw Dennis Miller's new show on HBO this week.  I also caught a "Dennis Miller Live" from 1995.

The HBO special was dull.  Dennis is getting old and conservative, and just didn't connect to the audience at all.  The special was also marred by having been taped before the whole Iraq thing, which is mostly old news now.

The "Live" show from 1995 was very funny, and Dennis connected with the audience right from the start, even when they were groaning at him.  It was dynamic and fun to watch.

Ah well, I suppose even the best of them have to catch the "I'm old and have nothing left to say" problem.  Paul McCartney has it.  George Carlin has it.  Why shouldn't Dennis Miller.  He's in good - if somewhat dull - company.
