Found a new web comic, via my friend Anne T., that I like.

<a href="http://www.lorebrandcomics.com/" title="Lore Brand Comics">Lore Brand Comics</a>

I had an "Amen Brother" moment for
<a href="http://www.lorebrandcomics.com/morethings.html" title="More Things">this one</a>,
and <a href="http://www.lorebrandcomics.com/whippedcream.html" title="Whipped Cream">this one</a>.
