Firstly, while I have assorted notes and half-finished emails from the while
I was away, quite a bit of the journal from this entry to January 20th is being
written on or after January 20th. But I want to document the things that I've
been doing, and I want the events to be linked to their actual dates. This makes
the next three weeks worth of journal a diary, really. But who cares.

Oh, and on this date, I flew to Des Moines, Ia, for the annual New Year's Eve
party that I go to every year.
