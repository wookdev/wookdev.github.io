I was looking at the referral logs for munged.org tonight.  The search keywords that bring people to my site are one of the things I can see.

For November, the number 1 search term that brings people to my site is "checked".

Number 2, however, makes me wonder just a little.  Number 2 search term is "kids having sex".

Okay, this makes me more than just wonder.  Not sure what, if anything I can do about it though.

I have an idea what you can do -- write more about squirrels having sex with melons.  (I guarantee "squirrels having sex with melons" will make the referral log next month!)
