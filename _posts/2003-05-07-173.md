Well, I went to <a href="http://www.demicon.org">DemiCon</a>, had a great time, and got home despite the airlines best attempts to strand me in DSM or ORD.  I managed to enjoy the whole time, despite suffering from an ugly headache from Sunday on.  I shot portraits on Friday and Saturday night, and over all I got almost 800 pictures from the weekend.  They will be going up somewhere on Munged as soon as I wade through them and process them.

In case you were wondering, the Hotel Fort Des Moines was great, and the con was a blast.  I think it is safe to say that a good time was had by all.
