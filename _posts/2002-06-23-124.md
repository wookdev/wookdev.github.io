<a href="http://www.riversoft.com/">RiverSoft</a>, the company I've been working
for these last 3+ years, is over and done. This last week, it was announced
to the world that the board of directors had arranged for the sale of the company
to <a href="http://www.micromuse.com/">Micromuse</a>.

To say that I'm bitter about this is an understatement. It is not unexpected
though. The writing was on the wall: the board, along with senior management,
and most of the staff, had lost faith in the prospects of the company long ago.
