I'm in Yosemite tonight.  This is my last day here, but it is snowing, and
it is supposed to drop a lot of snow on us.  We shall see.  If it does, I might
be stuck here until it clears.  Planning on leaving tomorrow to go to Death Valley
and poke around there.  Then on to Las Vegas, arriving on Sunday night for four
days.  I return to NYC on the 9th, and on to London on the 10th.

Today is my birthday. It has been a good day: First hike around the Yosemite
Valley floor, seeing beautiful stuff, take a tour and see other stuff, get a
massage, a perfect steak dinner, and then hang out with a bunch (30 or so) of
the locals/staff of the places around here.

All in all, a good day, and a very good week.
