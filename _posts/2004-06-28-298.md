I spent the weekend at my friends Dave and Haley's place.  It was a much needed break from routine, and a good time.  There is a winery, not a vinyard, just a winery, near them, and they invited some people to go on the tour and tasting.  It was a good time. Then they did a BBQ party, and that was a blast. I met some new people, and hooked up with friends of theirs that are friends of mine too, now.

I also got to meet their new dog Thor.  Thor is also a Bernese Mountain dog, and he's about 5 months old.  He's still puppy-cute, though he's starting to be the dog he will turn into.

As seems to be my fate these days, Thor, of course, hated me.  He wouldn't come near me the whole time I was there, unless he wasn't paying attention or I was asleep on the couch.  He was skitish with everyone he didn't know, but made special attempts to stay away from me.

What is it about me that dogs seem to freak out about me lately.  My brother's dog spends the entire visit while I'm at his place on Kev's bed.  Loki, Thors "brother", isn't bothered by me at all.

It was good to see Loki again too. She's mellowed a lot since I saw her last.  She's also filled out, and no longer the lanky, full-grown, puppy she was.
