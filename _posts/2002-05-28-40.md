I'm back from points West. My Missouri - Des Moines - London things turned
out to be somewhat lacking in "London", so I'm back tonight. Cancelled
meetings. Gotta hate that.

I'm way to wound up to get to sleep. Going to make tomorrow ugly.

The new camera seems to work great. Now I just have to learn how to use it
correctly in most situations. I've had fun with the couple of filters I own,
especially the pollarizing filter, which does interesting things. 

Fuji NPH film is pretty good. I got some astoundingly saturated colors from
some of my shots of flowers. Very happy with it. Going to try out some Fuji
Velvia when I can line up a subject worthy of taking pictures of with it.

I'm thinking that I'll go to Death Valley again this year in December, now
that I'm armed with all sorts of information on how to take good pictures of
the place. The previous pictures of the place all
turned out to be kinda dissapointing. I now know why at least some of them suck
so much. Armed with a few filters (UV, Cir PL, 81b, and maybe a graduated ND),
I'll go back on photo safari.

Or, I might sign up with <a href="http://www.moose395.net">Moose Peterson</a>.
Sounds like he does some interesting things. 

I walked in tonight, and found the apartment hugely depressing almost instantly
after passing through the door. I gotta do something about that.
