I joined FB again.

That lasted less than 2 months.

The reasons have to do with the nature of Facebook.  I love my friends, but they post things they need to post.  Posts about the traitor in the White House.  Posts about wearing a mask in this age of pandemic.  Posts about the shitty thing that happened to them recently.

I don't mind the posts about going somewhere to see/do something.  But I don't need to be reminded of the traitor in the White House.  I don't need to be reminded to wear a mask.  I am sympathetic, but if all you post is "oh woe is me..." I'm gonna tune out after a while.

I love you all.  But I deleted my account anyway.
