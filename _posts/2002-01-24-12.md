Not doing very well on keeping this updated, am I? I should also probably move
it to a web site that is a little more out of the way, so that I'm not announcing
the fact I'm not home to a site that is THIS public.

Anyway, was in Britain again, since a week ago Wednesday, which is, oh, lets
see... the 16th. I just got back.

RiverSoft is getting me a "Multiple Entry Work Permit" for the UK.
I'm over there often enough that it will be a good thing. I'm not sure what
all the ramifications are, but it does mean I can be there as often, and as
long, as I want. The only limitation on my time spent in that country will be
if I'm there more than 183 days, I have to pay UK income taxes. (Yeek!)

I found out that the UK government body responsible for taxes is also the IRS.
It stands for "Inland Revenue Service" though, and seems to usually
be called "Inland Revenue" rather than the abreviation.

My trusty old Dell laptop is starting to flake out again, screen-wise. The
backlight for the LCD display doesn't always come on, leaving the screen dark
(off, basically). If I hit the cover just above the hinges, it comes back. It
was doing this really bad at one point, and hasn't really been a problem lately.
Twice in a day today. Still, I've had really good luck with a laptop that will
be 3 in April.
