I'm going to violate one of <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/" title="Philip Greenspun's Home Page">Philip Greenspun's</a> <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/wtr/random-lessons.html" title="Things I learned the Hard Way">rules of web sites</a> and move things around here, and probably remove some of it.

The current site was designed when I was using Dreamweaver to generate everything.  So Journal pages were by month, because it was easier to create them by hand that way.  These days I have <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org/">Moveable Type</a>, and a few more options that I used to.

I'm not sure what all will change.  I do know that I'll try to fix some of the things that should work, but just never got done when I was working on this when <a href="/2003/03/16/2003-03-16-132">I had just started using MT</a>.

If anyone actually has links to this site, and would be pissed off if they suddenly went 404, let me know.

Things that changed so far:

* Made the MTObsfucate filter work again, so that names of people who post comments will show up now.  Note that the email is encoded as a Javascript to foil spammers.</li>

* Added the Acromyn MT plugin.  This takes a list of words, and creates &lt;acronym&gt; tags.  If your browser supports them (mine does), you will see an underline of acronyms, and if you mouse-over them, you will see a tool-text with a translation.  Or so the theory goes, anyway.</li>

* The "Read More..." will now show up only when the "extended part of the entry" exists.  I.E. "Read More..." now means there is more to read.</li>

No problem with you rearranging, but I do have one link into yours, so please let me know when you do so? Thanks!

Well, I may have completely messed up the Journal section.  I'll put it back together later.
