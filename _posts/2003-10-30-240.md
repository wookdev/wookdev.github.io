As of now, more or less, I am running Mac OS X 10.3 here at home, on both machines.  So far, all the stuff I run seems to work, except Stuffit Deluxe, which claims it can't find the stuffig engine.  But that's okay, because I don't run it much.

The bigger problem is that the name server (BIND) that I run on the Beast seems to have been clobbered.  That will actually prevent any access to the Internet for any machine.  I changed the DHCP config of my router, so I can get to the net.  I'll have to fix this some other time, it is late now.
