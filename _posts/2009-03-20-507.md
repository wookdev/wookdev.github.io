It has been pointed out that posting a title of "Salmonella" and then nothing for 2 months could be a cause for worry.  I figure no news is good news, but whatever.  Mea culpa.

The cipro did wonders.  I felt better the next day, and pretty much cured of all harmful symptoms by Monday.  The cipro didn't do a number on me either, which was good.

A couple of weeks after all that, I got a cold.
