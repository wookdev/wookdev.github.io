I let myself "go home early" today, and did movies all day. I saw
"Two Weeks Notice" this afternoon, and "About Schmidt" this
evening. I was going to re-watch LotR in a better theater, but it sold out just
as I got there, so I saw "Two Weeks" instead.

"Two Weeks Notice" was a nice little comedy. Nothing special, and
totally predictable. Watch it when it hits cable.

"About Schmidt" was pretty good. About a guy suffering from depression
after retirement, and his search for self-worth. Truly astounding performances
by Nicholson and Kathy Bates. Nicholson managed a character, rather than "Your
old buddy Jack" where his own personality comes through strongly. Kathy
Bates stole the show, she was so good.

Susan and Rob saw "About Schmidt" with me.
