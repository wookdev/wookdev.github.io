Well, <a href="http://www.demicon.org/" title="DemiCon">DemiCon 15</a> is over and done with, and it is my new favorite DemiCon ever.  A blast was had by all, I think.

I took 1183 photos this weekend.  The sequence numbers on the camera were about 100 higher than that, due to test shots and unusable shots deleted in the camera.  The photo archive is about 10 Gig of RAW files from the camera.  Over the next two weeks or so I'll be turning then into JPEG files and posting them here.  Masquerade and hall costume photos will go to Shutterfly like they did last year, so people can buy prints of them.

The plan is to have everything done by weekend after next, or so.  The masque and hall costume photos will be up first, then the con photos, then TICC photos.

Just curious when you might get the photo's from DemiCon up.
