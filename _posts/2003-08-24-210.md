When I loaded my <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> library, I did a couple of things that I wished I hadn't.  So I decided to reload my CDs, starting from scratch.  This wasn't as big a deal as you might think, I was only partially done.  Easily blown away.  Just as easily done again.

I decided I'd put **EVERYTHING** in my CD collection in the iTunes library.  Mostly, I'm curious how much space it'll take.  I'll have to come up with some way (there are several) of keeping the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> from being overly full.  This isn't a problem.

Part of deal is that on some things, you end up with assorted trash.  One of the first things to go in was a box set of <a href="http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/">The Who</a>.  (I'm starting from the back this time, for various reasons.)  This is the box set is cool, but has stuff I don't feel a huge need to listen to.  Crappy unreleased songs, inferior alternate versions of songs, and assorted humor from Keith Moon (who is funny, but tedious).  So that stuff has to be removed from the possibility of being listened to.

So I spent 3 hours listening to The Who.  And discovering that I haven't been listening to them often enough.  "Eminence Front" is in my top 5 favorite songs of all time.  Also enjoyed more than almost anything else: "Guitar and Pen", and "Music Must Change".  In fact, I took the CD out to The Stereo and played some of these songs through the Really Big Speakers.

Most people I know who are "Really Into Music" tell me that I'm not.  They say these things because I don't know who the lead singer of Soft Cell was.  But "Music hath charms to soothe a savage breast", and all that.  I do know that the world is okay, and life is good, when "Eminence Front" is playing.

NOTE: The URL for "<a href="http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/">The Who</a>" above actually points to <a href="http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/">Pete Townsend's web site</a>, because the official Who web site is <a href="http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/projects/thewho/">password protected</a> on his site.
