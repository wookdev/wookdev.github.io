Has anyone noticed that <a href="http://www.joewalsh.com/">Joe Walsh</a>, one of my favorite musicians of all time, mostly sucks?  Except of course, for when he doesn't.

Before you all post livid flames here, let me elaborate.

Joe Walsh has writen some things that are incredibly good.  Great, some of it.  But interspersed in all these classics is the most boring crap I've ever heard.  I wish it wasn't so.  But every album has one, or two, astoundingly great song(s).  And the rest of it you just want to escape from.

"Ordinary Average Guy" is about average.  It has one song that is truly amazing: "Look At Us Now".  The rest is utter dreck.  In <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> I have been rating some of the songs.  I had to give almost this entire album one or (rarely) two stars, out of 5, and I gave "Look At Us Now" 4 stars.  To make up for not giving it 5 stars (it isn't a 5 star song, even still) I put in my "Compulsive" playlist.

I'm glad Joe has been around for a while, so that his erratic genius has had time to pruduce enough music to fit on a large "best of" CD.

I've really enjoyed listening to that CD.
