My niece, Nikki, had her first hot date this last weekend, I hear. She will
soon be 17. I asked my brother if he had the requisite room full of guns or
martial arts trophies ready to impress the lucky boy. I thought his response
was good:

> I gave her two pieces of advice.
>
> For first dates, a movie and coffee is a big commitment. There needs
> to be a plan for a quick out, which as it turns out, she used after the
> movie.
>
> Tell him I own a gun.

Something to think about.
