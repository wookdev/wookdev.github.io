I am lazy, as we all know.  So lazy, that running across the street to grocery shop is way beyond me.  Yet, I've been doing it all these year, because, well, starving is maybe rather over the top.

So, imagine my delight at <a href="http://www.freshdirect.com/" title="Freshdirect">Freshdirect</a>, when they started deliverying to my neighborhood.  My first order is in, as of now.  Tomorrow night, we shall see what the result is.  Hopefully, food will show up.  Hopefully, it will be good food.

I hear they have the best produce on the east coast, and that the oranges are phenominal!  Yummmmm!

I think 4 comments is a record, btw.

I'm very busy, and searching for the bandwidth.  In the end, Fresh Direct was everything I was hoping it would be.  The produce was better than can be found in my 'hood.  It was delivered on time.  Even the sliced deli meats were probably higher quality than I can find here.

What hedonism!  You don't even have to leave your computer chair to shop for food, and if you order carefully, you don't even have to get up to prepare it.

Wook,

 Ah, but won't you miss those trips to the grocery store?  Waiting in the checkout line while the customer ahead of you tries to convince the checkout clerk that 5 cans of spinach should only count as one item.  Or the bawling kid in the cart behind you screaming for candy.  Or thumbing through the Weekly World News to catch up on Batboy's latest adventure.

 Your lose.  :)

Aren't you supposed to be able to find dates in the grocery store too?  Or was that the 80's?

There is just one woman in my neighborhood that I'm interested in, and that would be the dancer who lives in the 4th floor apartment across the street with the blue window shades...

Jeeze I'm pathetic.

Wouldn't say it's pathetic. Just see if Freshdirect will deliver binoculars.

Oh, but I have my camera, and a zoom lense or two...

Stalker?  What stalker?
