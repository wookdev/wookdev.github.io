While I was at Dave and Haley's last week for Thanksgiving, Dave invited me to
touch his [Love Sac][].  So I did.  I must say, Dave's [Love Sac][] is really
big.  He even let me fluff his [Love Sac][].  I fell asleep on his once too.

I got to flop on a Love Sac this week.  I can see why you enjoyed Dave's so much. It's nice he's willing to share. : )
