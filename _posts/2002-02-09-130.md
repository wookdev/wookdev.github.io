Well, I upgraded my iMac to Mac X a couple weeks ago. I was going
to write about what I thought about it. And I thought I had a good start going
too, until I finished and [this is the article][]
that came out. Mac X isn't mentioned until the very end, and almost in apology.
Not one of my better efforts, but what the hell. 

My thoughts on OS X will be written down. I also have a new iPod that I might say a
few things about too.
