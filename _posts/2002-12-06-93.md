After playing with it for a few weeks, I'm still not sure Moveable Type is
what I want to use for blogging on this site. Thing is, I'm not sure it isn't
what I want to use either. Maybe I should just do my own PHP thing.

One of the things I should have written about yesterday: Snow. It snowed here
yesterday. We had snow advisories and everything. This is the first real snow
this city has had in about 5 years now. I really miss snow. This is a magical
city when it snows. Everything is white, and the muffling effect of the snow
makes the city seem peaceful. But that lasts about 12 hours after the snow stops,
so I didn't really get to enjoy the new snow much.

Hanging with Helen and company tonight. Looking forward to it.
