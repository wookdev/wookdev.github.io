Possilby the <a href="http://www.alienlovespredator.com/index.php?id=80">funniest thing</a> I've seen in a while now, from <a href="http://www.alienlovespredator.com/" title="Alien Loves Predator">Alien Loves Predetor</a>.

ALP is a webcomic I just started reading a while ago.  The comic linked above is maybe funnier after you've read a few of them, and get used to the fact that Preston the Predator and Abe the Alien are just two guys who are roommates in NYC.  Abe is, of course, the pervert of the two.

I love this comic because New York City is the third character, though maybe you have to live here to get it.  These guys are living my life.

For those that might not get the enirely visual joke, Abe (the alien) is about to tap Preston (the predator) on the shoulder.  The rest should be obvious.
