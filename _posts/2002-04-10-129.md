After not updating this site for a month or more because
I forgot the password to get into the @)#^% web site, I've uploaded a
redesign.

One of the "rules of web design" is that once you've
laid out where anything on a web site is, you should leave it there forever.
Or, if you must move it, you should put "pointers" to the new stuff.
You do this to avoid making millions of people's bookmarks worthless.

Well, I have proof that I'm the only person who reads this
site, so it will change. Bookmarks will be messed up. The three of us
will just have to put up with it.
