Received the Linda Perry CD, "In Flight" today. Linda Perry is/was
the singer for the band 4 Non Blondes. "Bigger, Better, Faster, More?"
is the 4 Non Blondes album, and is one of my all time favorites. So when I found
out Linda had another album, I bought it. It came late, as an import, from Amazon,
but it arrived today.

Played it on the laptop while I was writing the last bit of flame mail today.
Tasty stuff. "In Flight" is not as high energy as 4 Non Blondes. Slower.

Had lunch with Jim today at Due South. Just like old times. Got to go upstairs
at 250 West and see the gang, many of whom are still there from my days at SSB.
The only person missing from the crew I was there with was Henry.

So Jim and I had a two Guinness lunch. Then I had two Buds after work in the
office while listening to a new product presentation. They called it a "Boot
Camp", but it was really a marketing exercise. Kept me in the office at
work when I was falling asleep on my feet from having had two beers at lunch.

So when I left, I had a hot pastrami on rye, and a Sprite, at the <a href="http://www.carnegiedeli.com/">Carnegie
Deli</a>. Then home.

I don't know why I didn't expect <a href="http://www.carnegiedeli.com/">Carnegie
Deli</a> to have a web site of their own. I am pleasantly surprised that they
do, though. <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> is an amazing thing.
