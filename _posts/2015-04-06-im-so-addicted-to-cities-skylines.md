title: "I'm sooooooooooo addicted to Cities: Skylines"

I'd planned on a semi-serious attempt to put all the [DemiCon][] and related photo galleries
back up at [WookPhoto][], since that's really what it is there for.  I was also going to
re-process all the photos before putting them up, because some of them really got no
love originally.  I know more now too, about how to make them look better.

But then [Cities: Skylines][] came out.  It was covered by Slashdot, as having sold 500,000
units in the first week.  Having once been a fan of Sim City, and hating the most
recent version, I decided to check Skylines out.

I am so addicted, it isn't funny.  Sorry, everyone, who wanted to see the photo
galleries.

In just a few short works, there's even a modding community sprung up, and asset
creators have gone nuts for this game too.  Gula, who says they were a level creator and 
artist on SimCity, has created [Gula's In-and-Out Burger][] that can be placed in
game.  You know I've got those all over all my cities.
