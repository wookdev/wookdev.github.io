Charles has to be home at noon or thereabouts, so he can be at work at 1 or
thereabouts. Ugh. I picked him up at Les and Jeannette's place at 8:30. That
is a time that actually has qualified as "middle of the night" most
of the last month. But, I got him home, and drove him to work on time.

Grandma was in Hinkley, gambling at a casino on a reservation there when I
arrived, so I basically drove around the area and found the old homesteads for
a few hours. Had lunch too. Grandma got home, and I picked her up and we went
to Aunt Betty's place.
