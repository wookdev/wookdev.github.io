This day wasn't a waste.  I didn't sleep well though, so I'd still rather have been at "home" without Internet access.

When I did get home, I found that Boris had been in.  He fixed the stove, and unplugged the tub.

He also made an attempt to get all the doors to shut and latch.  But rather than fix the problem, that the hinges have all been painted over so they can't close all the way, he shaved the doors, and installed really crappy-looking strike plates.  Only two of the doors now close, but all the doors now have shiny brass doorknobs.  There is also a layer of sawdust on everything.  Oh joy.

The rest of the repairs, I guess I'm going to do myself.

I should charge the slumlord $150 an hour, my personal consulting rate, for all the work I do fixing this place up.
