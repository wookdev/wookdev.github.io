I slept in much later than I thought i would, so I missed some of the festivities
of the day. But I did go down and spend 5 hours walking around downtown during
the afternoon. Shot 3 rolls of film. Got totally wind-blown. It was extremely
windy today. So windy, that I declined going out in it again to see the free
concert in Central Park.

I got some pictures I might be happy with, but I was using a totally in-appropriate
film, so probably not. We shall see what PhotoShop can make of them.

Highlights:

St. Paul's has a tour, that shows what has been going on there. It was a place
for the rescue and recovery crews at ground zero to go. The outpouring of support
and love displayed here by volunteers was surly a bright spot of the history
of humanity. Seeing the display was the only time I got misty-eyed the whole
time I was down there. This display is on for a while. Go see it, to learn what
heroism really is.

Pictures as soon as I can get them processed.
